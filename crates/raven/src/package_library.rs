// package_library.rs - Package library manager for package function awareness
//
// This module provides the PackageLibrary struct which manages installed R packages,
// their exports, and caching. It integrates with the R subprocess interface for
// querying package information and falls back to NAMESPACE file parsing when needed.
//
// Requirement 13.1: THE Package_Cache SHALL store parsed exports per package
// Requirement 13.4: THE Package_Cache SHALL support concurrent read access from multiple LSP handlers
