//! Static (never-executed) scan of testthat preamble files
//! (`tests/testthat/helper*.R` / `setup*.R`) into per-preamble harvested
//! symbol/attach sets. Symbols are the top-level defs of each file the
//! preamble transitively `source()`s (issue #638); the preamble's own defs come
//! from the live `RFileFacts` pipeline. Attachment sets are instead the
//! execution delta of the preamble root plus its sourced closure, because a
//! root `p_load()` may depend on an earlier preamble's attachment environment.
//! Packages already attached on entry are excluded from that root's delta.
//!
//! Directly mirrors the `.Rprofile` prelude scan (`rprofile.rs`): synchronous,
//! best-effort, bounded, and suppressive-only — over-harvesting can mask a
//! false positive but can never fabricate a diagnostic. Scans normally read
//! disk, while live-editor refreshes can overlay authoritative open buffers.
//! Path resolution uses metadata-free forward-source semantics through the
//! shared package-state closure walker, so a preamble's relative `source()`
//! targets anchor
//! at the implicit testthat working directory and computed
//! `file.path()`/`normalizePath()`/variable paths fold via
//! `cross_file::static_path` — the two halves of issue #638 that make the
//! sourced closure statically resolvable in the first place.
//!
//! Freshness: results enter `PackageInputs` (`preamble_sourced_*`) and are
//! refreshed when a preamble file or any file in `preamble_sourced_files`
//! changes in an open buffer or on disk. Preamble roots execute in lexical
//! filename order against one monotonic attachment environment. The
//! per-preamble source-file index finds directly affected roots. Later roots
//! are replayed only while their incoming attachment environment differs from
//! the previous scan, then incremental isolation resumes once it converges.
