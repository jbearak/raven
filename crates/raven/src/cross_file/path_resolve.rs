// Path resolution for cross-file awareness
//
// CRITICAL DESIGN NOTE: Forward vs Backward Directive Path Resolution
// ====================================================================
// Directives are written with the canonical `# raven:` prefix; the `@lsp-`
// forms named below are permanent aliases that parse identically.
// This module provides two PathContext constructors with DIFFERENT behaviors:
//
// 1. PathContext::new() - For BACKWARD directives (`# raven: sourced-by`, `# raven: run-by`, `# raven: included-by`)
//    - IGNORES `# raven: cd` working directory
//    - Always resolves paths relative to the file's own directory
//    - Rationale: Backward directives describe static file relationships from the child's
//      perspective. They declare "this file is sourced by that parent file" - a relationship
//      that should NOT change based on runtime working directory.
//
// 2. PathContext::from_metadata() - For FORWARD directives (`# raven: source`, `# raven: run`, `# raven: include`)
//                                   and source() calls
//    - USES `# raven: cd` working directory when present
//    - Resolves paths relative to the working directory (or file's directory if no `# raven: cd`)
//    - Rationale: Forward directives and source() calls describe runtime execution behavior.
//      They are semantically equivalent to R's source() function, which is affected by
//      the current working directory at runtime.
//
// DO NOT change this behavior without understanding the full implications for cross-file
// awareness. User-facing explanation lives in `docs/cross-file.md`.
