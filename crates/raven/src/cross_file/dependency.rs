///
/// # Arguments
/// * `parent_uri` - The URI of the parent file
/// * `get_metadata` - A closure that retrieves metadata for a given URI
/// * `workspace_root` - Optional workspace root URI for resolving workspace-relative paths
/// * `remaining_depth` - Remaining depth for inheritance chain traversal
/// * `visited` - Set of URIs already visited during this inheritance resolution (for cycle detection)

/// * `Some(String)` - The parent's effective working directory as a string path

///   only working directory is the implicit testthat/testit soft default

/// # Fallback Behavior
/// If parent metadata cannot be retrieved via `get_metadata`, or if the depth limit is
/// reached, the function falls back to using the parent file's directory as the effective
/// working directory.

/// # Cycle Detection
/// When a URI is encountered that's already in the visited set, the function stops
/// inheritance and returns the *direct parent's directory*. This breaks the loop while still
/// allowing the child to inherit from its parent.
///
/// # Implicit test working directory (issue #638)
/// Every fallback that would return the parent's raw file directory (cycle,
/// depth exhausted, metadata unavailable) instead returns `None` when the
/// parent lies under `tests/testthat|testit/` — see
/// `fallback_parent_directory`. The implicit anchor never propagates into
/// sourced children, and these fallbacks must not reintroduce it as an
/// inherited (hard) working directory while the parent is simply unindexed.
///
/// # Transitive Inheritance
/// When the parent has an inherited_working_directory in its metadata (from its own parent),
/// that value is used through PathContext::from_metadata. This enables transitive inheritance:
/// A → B → C where A has `# raven: cd` (the `@lsp-cd` form is a permanent alias that

    /// 1. **`query_inside_function` (local scoping).** Current-frame and
    ///    non-inheriting source destinations can apply a
    ///    `query_inside_function`-dependent declared-only inheritance policy
    ///    that the memo key omits. This is handled
    ///    by **slot isolation** in `ScopeStream`: the `query_inside_function =
    ///    true` (hoisted, inside-a-function) prefix slot gets its OWN fresh memo,
    ///    so only the mutually-consistent `false`-context computations (the
    ///    `false` top slot plus every per-child-source call, which all query at
    ///    EOF) ever share. This gate does NOT cover that mode.
    /// 2. **Truncation (visited context).** A memo hit short-circuits a walk that
    ///    would otherwise mark `visited`, perturbing a sibling path's truncation
    ///    (`depth_exceeded`/`chain`). This gate bounds the part of that mode that
    ///    can corrupt the **symbol set**: disable sharing unless the whole
    ///    bidirectional neighborhood sits at BFS depth `< max_depth - 1`. The
    ///    bound is SOUND for symbols regardless of the depth check's precision,
    ///    because a truncating resolution carries a non-empty `depth_exceeded`
    ///    and is therefore never written to the memo (the
    ///    `computed.depth_exceeded.is_empty()` guard in
    ///    `resolve_forward_child_memoized`), so the cache can never feed a
    ///    truncated (wrong) symbol set to another prefix root. The
    ///    `depth_exceeded`/`chain` channel itself has a bounded residual — see
    ///    the NOTE below and issue #484.
    ///
    /// The BFS runs over the bidirectional source neighborhood (global
    /// `visited`, O(V+E)) bounded by `budget`; on exhaustion the method returns
    /// `false` (conservatively disabling sharing — sound, just no speedup).
    /// Realistic global-scope hubs (default `maxChainDepth` 64, shallow chains)
    /// pass and get the full O(N²)→O(N) collapse.

    /// NOTE on the depth check (residual risk — issue #484): BFS depth is the
    /// *shortest* bidirectional distance, while the resolver can reach a node at
    /// a greater `current_depth` via a *longer* path (forward children resolve
    /// with cloned `visited`, and the backward-then-forward walk can revisit).
