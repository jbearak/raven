## Notes

- All tasks including tests are required for comprehensive coverage
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- The implementation follows the existing patterns in source_detect.rs and scope.rs
