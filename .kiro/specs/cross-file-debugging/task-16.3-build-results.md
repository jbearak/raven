### Build Warnings

The following warnings were generated during compilation (non-critical):

1. **Unused import**: `BackwardDirective` in `parent_resolve.rs:15`
2. **Unused function**: `collect_identifier_usages` in `handlers.rs:710`
3. **Unused function**: `parse_namespace_imports` in `state.rs:271`
4. **Unused methods**: `index_workspace`, `load_workspace_namespace`, `index_directory` in `state.rs`

These warnings do not affect functionality and can be addressed in future cleanup.

## Test Files Created

The following test files have been created for manual testing:

### 1. validation_functions/get_colnames.r
```r
# Function to get column names from a data frame
get_colnames <- function(df) {
  colnames(df)
}
```

### 2. validation_functions/collate.r
```r
# Collate validation functions
source("get_colnames.r")

# Use the function from get_colnames.r
result <- get_colnames(my_data)
```

### 3. oos.r
```r
# Parent file that sources child files
source("subdir/child.r")

# Use functions from child
result <- my_function()
```

### 4. subdir/child.r
```r
# @lsp-run-by: ../oos.r

# Child file with backward directive
my_function <- function() {
  print("Hello from child")
}
```

## Manual Testing Required

The extension has been built and installed successfully. **Manual testing in VS Code is now required** to verify the following:

### Test Checklist

- [ ] **Test 1**: Open `validation_functions/collate.r` and verify `get_colnames()` is NOT marked as undefined
- [ ] **Test 2**: Verify completion shows `get_colnames` after typing `get_` in collate.r
- [ ] **Test 3**: Open `subdir/child.r` and verify NO "parent file not found" error for the `@lsp-run-by: ../oos.r` directive
- [ ] **Test 4**: Open `oos.r` and verify `my_function()` is NOT marked as undefined

### Testing Instructions

Please refer to the comprehensive **Manual Testing Guide** at:
`.kiro/specs/cross-file-debugging/manual-testing-guide.md`

This guide provides:
- Detailed step-by-step instructions for each test
- Expected results for each scenario
- Debugging tips if issues are encountered
- A results template for documenting findings

## How to Perform Manual Testing

1. **Open VS Code** in the rlsp workspace directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/rlsp
   code .
   ```

2. **Open the test files** listed above

3. **Follow the testing guide** at `.kiro/specs/cross-file-debugging/manual-testing-guide.md`

4. **Document results** for each test scenario

5. **Check LSP logs** if any issues are encountered:
   - View > Output > Select "Rlsp" from dropdown

## Expected Outcomes

Based on the integration tests (tasks 16.1 and 16.2), we expect:

✅ **Likely to work**:
- Metadata extraction (source() calls and directives are detected)
- Dependency graph construction (edges are created correctly)
- Path resolution (relative paths like `../oos.r` resolve correctly)

❓ **Needs verification**:
- LSP handler integration (do handlers actually use cross-file scope?)
- Real-time symbol resolution in the editor
- Completion showing symbols from sourced files
- Diagnostics not marking sourced symbols as undefined

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check:

1. **Extension is running**: Command Palette > "Developer: Show Running Extensions"
2. **Correct binary**: Settings > Search "rlsp.server.path"
3. **LSP logs**: View > Output > "Rlsp"
4. **Restart**: Command Palette > "Developer: Reload Window"

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Build completed successfully
2. ✅ Test files created
3. ✅ Testing guide prepared
4. ⏳ **Manual testing required** - Please perform the tests in VS Code
5. ⏳ Document results
6. ⏳ Report findings

## Notes

- The build process completed without errors
- All warnings are non-critical (unused code)
- The extension is properly packaged and installed
- Test files are ready for manual verification
- Comprehensive testing guide is available

## Conclusion

**Task 16.3 Build Phase: COMPLETE ✅**

The rlsp extension has been successfully built and installed. The automated portion of this task is complete. Manual testing in VS Code is now required to verify that cross-file awareness works correctly in real-world usage.

Please proceed with manual testing using the guide at:
`.kiro/specs/cross-file-debugging/manual-testing-guide.md`
