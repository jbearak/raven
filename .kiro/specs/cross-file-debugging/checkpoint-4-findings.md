## Component Analysis

### 1. Logging Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Comprehensive logging has been implemented throughout the cross-file system.

**Evidence**:
- `directive.rs`: Logs directive parsing with details
- `source_detect.rs`: Logs source() call detection
- `dependency.rs`: Logs edge addition/removal and graph state
- `scope.rs`: Logs scope resolution traversal and symbol counts
- `handlers.rs`: Logs cross-file function calls in LSP handlers
- `integration_tests.rs`: Logs test workspace operations

**Sample Logging Points**:
```rust
// Metadata extraction
log::trace!("Extracting cross-file metadata from content ({} bytes)", content.len());
log::trace!("Found source() call: {} at line {}", path, line);
log::trace!("Parsed backward directive: {:?}", directive);

// Dependency graph
log::trace!("Adding edge: {} -> {} at line {:?}", parent, child, line);
log::trace!("Dependency graph now has {} total edges", total_edges);

// Scope resolution
log::trace!("Resolving scope at {}:{}", file, position);
log::trace!("Found {} symbols in scope", symbol_count);

// LSP handlers
log::trace!("Calling get_cross_file_symbols for completion");
log::trace!("Got {} symbols from cross-file scope", symbols.len());
```

### 2. Metadata Extraction ✅ WORKING

**Status**: Source() call detection and directive parsing are working correctly.

**Evidence**:
- All source detection tests pass (single/double quotes, sys.source, parameters)
- All directive parsing tests pass (all synonyms, optional colon/quotes)
- Real-world tests show correct metadata extraction

**Verified Functionality**:
- ✅ Detects source("file.r") with single and double quotes
- ✅ Detects sys.source() calls
- ✅ Parses backward directives (@lsp-run-by, @lsp-sourced-by, @lsp-included-by)
- ✅ Parses forward directives (@lsp-source)
- ✅ Parses working directory directives (all synonyms)
- ✅ Handles optional colon and quotes in directives
- ✅ Extracts call site positions in UTF-16 columns

### 3. Path Resolution ✅ WORKING

**Status**: Path resolution is working correctly for relative and absolute paths.

**Evidence**:
- Backward directive test shows ../oos.r resolves correctly
- Property tests for path resolution all pass
- Working directory directives are handled correctly

**Verified Functionality**:
- ✅ Resolves relative paths (./file.r, ../file.r)
- ✅ Resolves paths relative to file's directory
- ✅ Resolves paths relative to working directory when specified
- ✅ Handles ../ navigation correctly
- ✅ Normalizes paths with . and .. components
- ✅ Handles both forward and backslashes

### 4. Dependency Graph ✅ WORKING

**Status**: Dependency graph construction and querying are working correctly.

**Evidence**:
- All dependency graph tests pass
- Real-world tests show correct edge creation
- Parent/child queries return correct results

**Verified Functionality**:
- ✅ Creates forward edges from source() calls
- ✅ Creates forward edges from backward directives
- ✅ Stores call site positions (line, column in UTF-16)
- ✅ Deduplicates edges correctly
- ✅ Handles directive-vs-AST conflict resolution
- ✅ Supports parent and child queries
- ✅ Removes edges when files are updated

### 5. Scope Resolution ✅ WORKING

**Status**: Scope resolution is working correctly at the component level.

**Evidence**:
- All scope resolution tests pass
- Symbol extraction and precedence rules work correctly
- Chain traversal and cycle detection work

**Verified Functionality**:
- ✅ Includes symbols from sourced files
- ✅ Handles multiple source() calls
- ✅ Traverses source chains up to max_chain_depth
- ✅ Prioritizes local symbols over sourced symbols
- ✅ Detects cycles and prevents infinite loops
- ✅ Returns symbols with name, type, and source file

### 6. LSP Handler Integration ✅ LOGGING PRESENT

**Status**: LSP handlers have logging for cross-file operations.

**Evidence**:
- Handlers log calls to get_cross_file_symbols()
- Handlers log symbol counts returned
- Completion, hover, definition, and diagnostics all have cross-file logging

**Verified Logging**:
- ✅ Completion handler logs cross-file symbol retrieval
- ✅ Hover handler logs cross-file symbol lookup
- ✅ Definition handler logs cross-file symbol search
- ✅ Diagnostics handler logs undefined variable checks with cross-file scope

**Note**: The integration tests use helper functions that don't fully simulate LSP request/response cycles. Full end-to-end testing requires running the LSP server with a client (VS Code extension).

## Key Findings

### ✅ What's Working

1. **All Core Components**: Metadata extraction, path resolution, dependency graph, and scope resolution are all working correctly at the unit and integration test level.

2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Trace logging is implemented throughout the system, making it possible to debug issues when they occur.

3. **Real-World Scenarios**: The three real-world failure reproduction tests all pass:
   - validation_functions/collate.r scenario
   - Backward directive ../oos.r scenario
   - Basic source() call scenario

4. **Property-Based Testing**: All 254 property tests pass, indicating that the system maintains its invariants across a wide range of inputs.

5. **Error Handling**: The system handles errors gracefully and continues operating after non-fatal errors.

### 🔍 What Needs Investigation

1. **LSP Handler Integration**: While the handlers have logging and call cross-file functions, the integration tests don't fully simulate LSP request/response cycles. The TODO comments in the tests indicate that full completion/hover/diagnostics testing requires LSP infrastructure.

2. **Real-World Usage**: The tests pass at the component level, but the original issue report mentioned that "symbols from sourced files are not being recognized in practice." This suggests the issue may be in:
   - How the LSP server is initialized
   - How document lifecycle events trigger metadata extraction
   - How the WorldState is updated when files change
   - How the VS Code extension communicates with the server

3. **Document Lifecycle**: The tests don't verify that:
   - textDocument/didOpen triggers metadata extraction
   - textDocument/didChange triggers revalidation
   - Diagnostics are published to affected files

### 📋 Recommended Next Steps

Based on the test results, I recommend:

1. **Run with RUST_LOG=rlsp=trace in VS Code**: 
   - Open the real validation_functions/collate.r file in VS Code
   - Check the LSP server logs to see if metadata extraction is triggered
   - Verify if scope resolution is called during completion requests
   - Check if symbols from sourced files are found

2. **Verify Document Lifecycle Integration**:
   - Check if didOpen/didChange handlers call extract_metadata()
   - Verify WorldState is updated with new metadata
   - Confirm revalidation is triggered for affected files

3. **Test End-to-End with VS Code Extension**:
   - Build and install: `./setup.sh`
   - Open a workspace with source() calls
   - Request completion after a source() call
   - Check if symbols from sourced file appear
   - Check if diagnostics mark sourced symbols as undefined

4. **If Issues Persist, Check**:
   - Configuration: Is cross-file enabled in VS Code settings?
   - Initialization: Is CrossFileConfig properly initialized?
   - Content Provider: Does it supply file content correctly?
   - Cache: Are cache entries being populated and retrieved?

## Conclusion

**All tests pass at the component and integration level.** The cross-file system components (metadata extraction, path resolution, dependency graph, scope resolution) are working correctly. The logging infrastructure is comprehensive and ready for debugging.

**However**, the integration tests don't fully simulate LSP request/response cycles. The original issue ("symbols from sourced files are not being recognized in practice") suggests the problem may be in:
- LSP server initialization
- Document lifecycle event handling
- WorldState updates
- VS Code extension communication

**Recommendation**: Proceed to test with the actual VS Code extension using RUST_LOG=rlsp=trace to identify where the execution flow breaks in real-world usage. The logging infrastructure is in place to trace the issue.
