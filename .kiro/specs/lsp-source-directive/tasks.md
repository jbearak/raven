# Implementation Plan: @lsp-source Forward Directive

## Overview

This plan implements the `@lsp-source` forward directive for Raven, adding synonym support (`@lsp-run`, `@lsp-include`), `line=N` parameter parsing, proper path resolution with `@lsp-cd` support, and conflict resolution between directives and AST-detected `source()` calls.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Extend directive parsing with synonyms and line parameter
  - [x] 1.1 Update forward directive regex in `directive.rs`
    - Add `@lsp-run` and `@lsp-include` as synonyms to the regex pattern
    - Add optional `line=N` parameter capture group
    - Pattern: `#\s*@?lsp-(?:source|run|include)\s*:?\s*(?:"([^"]+)"|'([^']+)'|(\S+))(?:\s+line\s*=\s*(\d+))?`
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9_

  - [x] 1.2 Update `parse_forward_directives()` to handle line parameter
    - Parse the `line=N` capture group when present
    - Convert from 1-based user input to 0-based internal (N-1)
    - Use directive's own line when no `line=` parameter
    - Set `column=0` for all directive-based sources
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

  - [x] 10.1 Update AGENTS.md with forward directive path resolution behavior
    - Clarify forward directives (@lsp-source, @lsp-run, @lsp-include) use @lsp-cd
    - Distinguish from backward directives which ignore @lsp-cd
    - Explain rationale: forward directives describe runtime execution like source()
    - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3_

  - [x] 10.2 Update docs/cross-file.md with @lsp-source documentation
    - Expand Forward Directives section with @lsp-source and synonyms

- [x] 11. Final checkpoint - Ensure all tests pass
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.

## Notes

- All tasks including property tests are required for comprehensive coverage
- Property tests use proptest and run minimum 100 iterations each
- Key files: `directive.rs`, `dependency.rs`, `path_resolve.rs`, `handlers.rs`, `scope.rs`
- The existing @lsp-source parsing works; this adds synonyms, line= parameter, and explicit @lsp-cd documentation
