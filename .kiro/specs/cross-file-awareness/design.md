# Design Document: Cross-File Awareness for Rlsp

## Overview

This design document describes the architecture and implementation approach for adding cross-file awareness to Rlsp. The feature enables the LSP to understand relationships between R source files through `source()` calls and special comment directives, providing accurate symbol resolution, diagnostics, and navigation across file boundaries.

The implementation follows Rlsp's existing patterns: tree-sitter for parsing, `RwLock` for thread-safe state, and integration with the existing `WorldState` and `Document` structures. Per project coding guidelines: use `log::trace!` instead of `log::debug!`, use explicit `return Err(anyhow!(...))` instead of `bail!`, and omit `return` in match expressions.

### Data Flow

1. **In-memory document change**: When a document is opened or modified (`didOpen`/`didChange`), the Directive Parser and Source Detector extract cross-file metadata from the in-memory document contents.
2. **Disk/workspace change**: When a file changes on disk (`workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`), the server invalidates disk-backed caches/index entries for that URI/path and updates workspace indexing (see **Workspace Watching + Indexing (Required)**).
3. **Cache update**: Parsed metadata is stored in the metadata cache; the Dependency Graph is updated.
4. **Invalidation**: Dependent scope caches are invalidated based on the Dependency Graph.
5. **Revalidation**: The Revalidation Engine schedules diagnostics updates for affected open files.
6. **Resolution**: LSP handlers query the Scope Resolver, which lazily computes scope chains using cached data.
7. **Response**: Handlers use resolved scope to provide completions, hover info, definitions, and diagnostics.

## Components and Interfaces

### Unified Cross-File Metadata Model (Single Source of Truth)

#### Position Conventions (Required)

- LSP positions are 0-based for both `line` and `character`.
- Directive syntax `line=` is 1-based for user ergonomics (Requirement 1.4).
- Internally, all stored positions in `CrossFileMetadata`, dependency edges, and scope artifacts MUST be 0-based.
- The implementation MUST convert user-facing 1-based line numbers to internal 0-based representation.

**Full Position Awareness (Required):**
Position-awareness MUST use full `(line, character)` positions, not just line numbers. This is critical for edge cases like:
- `x <- 1; source("a.R"); y <- foo()` on one line
- Completion/hover requests at a character position on the same line as a `source()` call

If only line-based gating is used, symbols may be incorrectly included/excluded for positions on the same line as the call. The implementation MUST:
- Store call sites as full LSP `Position` (`line`, `character`) in events/edges
- Gate symbol availability by `(line, char)` ordering: a symbol from a sourced file is available only at positions strictly after the call site position

**Documented Limitation (Alternative):**
If full `(line, character)` precision is not implemented, the spec MUST explicitly document this as a known limitation: "Symbols from sourced files become available at the start of the line following the source() call, not at the exact character position after the call."

The implementation uses **one** structured representation for cross-file metadata (`CrossFileMetadata`) which is:
- derived from document contents (directives + detected `source()` calls)
- serializable (for debugging/tests)
- used to update the dependency graph and drive scope resolution

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use std::collections::HashSet;

/// Complete cross-file metadata for a document
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CrossFileMetadata {
    /// Backward directives (this file is sourced by others)
    pub sourced_by: Vec<BackwardDirective>,
    /// Forward directives and detected source() calls
    pub sources: Vec<ForwardSource>,
    /// Working directory override
    pub working_directory: Option<String>,
    /// Lines with @lsp-ignore
    pub ignored_lines: HashSet<u32>,
    /// Lines following @lsp-ignore-next
    pub ignored_next_lines: HashSet<u32>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct BackwardDirective {
    pub path: String,
    pub call_site: CallSiteSpec,
    pub directive_line: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct ForwardSource {
    pub path: String,
    pub line: u32,
    pub column: u32,  // Character position for full (line, char) precision
    pub is_directive: bool, // true if @lsp-source, false if detected source()
    pub local: bool,
    pub chdir: bool,
    pub is_sys_source: bool,
}

/// Canonical key for edge deduplication.
/// Used to prevent duplicate edges when both directive and AST detection find the same relationship.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct ForwardSourceKey {
    pub resolved_uri: Url,
    pub call_site_line: u32,
    pub call_site_column: u32,
    pub local: bool,
    pub chdir: bool,
    pub is_sys_source: bool,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum CallSiteSpec {
    Default,
    Line(u32),
    Match(String),
}

pub trait CrossFileExtractor {
    /// Extract CrossFileMetadata from file content (directives + detected source() calls)
    /// 
    /// IMPORTANT: Forward sources MUST be deduplicated by canonical key before returning.
    /// When both a directive and AST detection produce the same (resolved_uri, call_site, local, chdir, is_sys_source),
    /// only one ForwardSource should be included. Prefer the directive (is_directive=true) for provenance tracking.
    fn extract(&self, content: &str, tree: Option<&tree_sitter::Tree>) -> CrossFileMetadata;

    /// Check if a line should have diagnostics suppressed
    fn is_line_ignored(&self, metadata: &CrossFileMetadata, line: u32) -> bool;
    
    /// Normalize forward sources to canonical set, deduplicating by key.
    /// Returns deduplicated sources with provenance flags preserved.
    fn normalize_forward_sources(&self, sources: Vec<ForwardSource>, base_uri: &Url) -> Vec<ForwardSource>;
}
```


### Call-Site Resolution (Backward Directives)

Backward directives require identifying where the parent sourced the child. Resolution priority:
1. explicit `line=` (validate in-bounds + validate line contains relevant call)
2. explicit `match=` (find string, map to line)
3. reverse dependency edges (parent → child)
4. text inference in parent file (static string-literal `source()`/`sys.source()` only)
5. config default (`assumeCallSite`)

This mirrors Sight's robustness and is necessary to avoid defaulting too often.

### Source Detection (part of CrossFileExtractor)

Detects `source()` and `sys.source()` calls in R code using tree-sitter.

```rust
/// A detected source() call in the code
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct SourceCall {
    pub path: String,
    pub line: u32,
    pub column: u32,
    pub is_sys_source: bool,
    pub local: bool,      // source(..., local = TRUE)
    pub chdir: bool,      // source(..., chdir = TRUE)
}

pub trait SourceDetector {
    /// Extract all resolvable source() calls from a parsed tree
    fn detect(&self, tree: &Tree, content: &str) -> Vec<SourceCall>;
}
```

### Path Resolver

Resolves relative paths to absolute paths considering working directory context.

```rust
/// Context for path resolution
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct PathContext {
    pub file_path: PathBuf,
    pub working_directory: Option<PathBuf>,
    pub inherited_working_directory: Option<PathBuf>,
}

pub trait PathResolver {
    /// Resolve a path string to an absolute path
    fn resolve(&self, path: &str, context: &PathContext) -> Option<PathBuf>;
    
    /// Get the effective working directory for a context
    fn effective_working_directory(&self, context: &PathContext) -> PathBuf;
}
```


### Dependency Graph

Tracks source relationships between files and drives cache invalidation + diagnostics fanout.

Key properties:
- Supports multiple edges between the same (from,to) at different call sites.
- Stores enough metadata to support backward call-site resolution via reverse deps.
- Uses canonicalized URIs/paths to avoid duplicate nodes for the same file.

```rust
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
use tower_lsp::lsp_types::Url;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub enum EdgeKind {
    Forward,  // parent sources child
    Backward, // child declares parent via directive
}

/// One call edge (a parent may source the same child multiple times).
///
/// The edge payload MUST include any fields that affect scope semantics so:
/// - reverse-dep call-site inference can validate the relationship
/// - scope resolution can apply correct inheritance rules
/// - cache fingerprints are stable and complete
///
/// IMPORTANT: Edges are deduplicated by canonical key (to_uri, call_site_position, local, chdir, is_sys_source).
/// Provenance flags (is_directive) are tracked separately but do not create separate semantic edges.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct DependencyEdge {
    pub from: Url,
    pub to: Url,
    pub kind: EdgeKind,

    /// 0-based line number in `from` where the call occurs (if known).
    pub call_site_line: Option<u32>,
    
    /// 0-based character position in `from` where the call occurs (if known).
    /// Required for full (line, char) position-aware scope resolution.
    pub call_site_column: Option<u32>,

    /// `source(..., local=TRUE)` semantics.
    pub local: bool,

    /// `source(..., chdir=TRUE)` semantics.
    pub chdir: bool,

    /// True for sys.source() edges, false for source() edges.
    pub is_sys_source: bool,

    /// True if declared via @lsp-source directive, false if detected from AST.
    /// This is provenance metadata and does NOT affect edge identity for deduplication.
    pub is_directive: bool,
}

pub struct DependencyGraph {
    forward: HashMap<Url, Vec<DependencyEdge>>,
    backward: HashMap<Url, Vec<DependencyEdge>>,
}

impl DependencyGraph {
    pub fn new() -> Self;

    /// Update edges for a file based on extracted metadata.
    pub fn update_file(&mut self, uri: &Url, meta: &CrossFileMetadata);

    pub fn remove_file(&mut self, uri: &Url);

    pub fn get_dependencies(&self, uri: &Url) -> Vec<&DependencyEdge>;

    pub fn get_dependents(&self, uri: &Url) -> Vec<&DependencyEdge>;

    pub fn get_transitive_dependents(&self, uri: &Url, max_depth: usize) -> Vec<Url>;
}
```


### Scope Resolver (Position-Aware)

Scope resolution is position-aware because `source()` introduces symbols only *after* its call site.

The resolver exposes a single core query: **scope at a position**.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::path::PathBuf;
use tower_lsp::lsp_types::Url;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ScopedSymbol {
    pub name: String,
    pub kind: SymbolKind,
    pub source_uri: Url,
    pub defined_line: u32,
    pub signature: Option<String>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum ScopeError {
    MissingFile { path: String, referenced_from: Url, line: u32 },
    CircularDependency { cycle: Vec<Url> },
    MaxDepthExceeded { depth: usize },
    AmbiguousParents { parents: Vec<Url> },
}

/// A reusable per-file artifact: exported interface + a timeline of scope-introducing events.
///
/// IMPORTANT: call-site filtering correctness requires more than a final exported interface.
/// Parents may introduce symbols via their own forward source() calls; children should only
/// see the subset that is in-scope at the parent's call site.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ScopeArtifacts {
    /// Public surface used by dependents when importing this file wholesale.
    pub exported_interface: HashMap<String, ScopedSymbol>,

    /// A deterministic, line-ordered event stream used to compute scope-at-line.
    pub timeline: Vec<ScopeEvent>,

    /// Stable hash of exported_interface AND any semantics-bearing aspects of the timeline.
    pub interface_hash: u64,

    pub errors: Vec<ScopeError>,
}

/// A scope-introducing event within a file.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum ScopeEvent {
    /// A symbol definition introduced at a specific position.
    Def { line: u32, column: u32, symbol: ScopedSymbol },

    /// A forward source edge introduced at a call site position.
    /// The sourced file's interface becomes available strictly after `(call_site_line, call_site_column)`.
    Source { call_site_line: u32, call_site_column: u32, edge: DependencyEdge },

    /// A working directory change that affects subsequent path resolution.
    WorkingDirectory { line: u32, absolute_path: PathBuf },
}

/// A computed scope at a particular position in a file.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ScopeAtPosition {
    pub symbols: HashMap<String, ScopedSymbol>,
    pub chain: Vec<Url>,
    pub errors: Vec<ScopeError>,
}

/// Legacy alias for line-only scope (deprecated, use ScopeAtPosition)
pub type ScopeAtLine = ScopeAtPosition;

pub trait ScopeResolver {
    /// Compute per-file artifacts used by dependents (hashable interface).
    fn compute_artifacts(&self, uri: &Url, state: &WorldState, config: &CrossFileConfig) -> ScopeArtifacts;

    /// Resolve scope visible at a given position in `uri`.
    /// Position is (line, character), both 0-based.
    fn scope_at_position(&self, uri: &Url, line: u32, character: u32, state: &WorldState, config: &CrossFileConfig) -> ScopeAtPosition;
    
    /// Legacy: Resolve scope visible at a given line in `uri` (character=0).
    fn scope_at_line(&self, uri: &Url, line: u32, state: &WorldState, config: &CrossFileConfig) -> ScopeAtPosition {
        self.scope_at_position(uri, line, 0, state, config)
    }
}
```

Implementation notes:
- `timeline` MUST be sufficient to compute `scope_at_position(uri, line, char)` without accidentally including symbols introduced after that position via forward sourcing.
- `scope_at_position` merges local defs + inherited interfaces gated by call-site ordering, using the parent's own position-aware scope at the call site.
- Both use call-site resolution ladder for backward directives (explicit → reverse deps → inference → default).
- Position comparison: `(line1, char1) < (line2, char2)` iff `line1 < line2 || (line1 == line2 && char1 < char2)`.

Required boundary:
- `compute_artifacts(uri, ...)` MUST depend only on the file's own content/AST plus pre-existing dependency metadata (edges), and MUST NOT call `scope_at_position` for other files. This prevents recursion and avoids exponential recomputation.
- `scope_at_position` MAY traverse to other files, but it MUST be bounded by `max_chain_depth` and MUST maintain a visited set to prevent cycles.

Caching requirement (performance + correctness):
- Cache entries for `ScopeArtifacts` and `scope_at_position` MUST be fingerprinted so that concurrent edits and index updates cannot reuse stale results (see ScopeFingerprint).

Upstream hashing boundary (Required):
- `upstream_interfaces_hash` in `ScopeFingerprint` MUST be computed as a hash of the **directly referenced** children's `interface_hash` values (from cache/index), plus the **edge set hash** for this file, plus this file's own content hash.
- This keeps artifact computation cheap and non-recursive.
- Full transitive correctness is left to `scope_at_position` traversal (bounded + visited set).


### Configuration

Configuration options support all settings from Requirement 11.

```rust
/// Cross-file awareness configuration
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct CrossFileConfig {
    /// Maximum depth for backward directive traversal (Requirement 11.1)
    pub max_backward_depth: usize,
    /// Maximum depth for forward source() traversal (Requirement 11.2)
    pub max_forward_depth: usize,
    /// Maximum total chain depth (Requirement 11.3)
    pub max_chain_depth: usize,
    /// Default call site assumption when not specified (Requirement 11.4)
    pub assume_call_site: CallSiteDefault,
    /// Whether to index workspace files (Requirement 11.5)
    pub index_workspace: bool,

    /// Max number of open documents to schedule for diagnostics revalidation per trigger (Requirement 11.6)
    pub max_revalidations_per_trigger: usize,

    /// Debounce delay for cross-file diagnostics fanout (Requirement 11.7)
    pub revalidation_debounce_ms: u64,

    /// Whether undefined variable diagnostics are enabled (Requirement 11.9, 11.10)
    pub undefined_variables_enabled: bool,
    
    /// Severity for missing file diagnostics (Requirement 11.8)
    pub missing_file_severity: DiagnosticSeverity,
    /// Severity for circular dependency diagnostics (Requirement 11.8)
    pub circular_dependency_severity: DiagnosticSeverity,
    /// Severity for out-of-scope symbol diagnostics (Requirement 11.8)
    pub out_of_scope_severity: DiagnosticSeverity,
    /// Severity for ambiguous parent diagnostics (Requirement 11.8)
    pub ambiguous_parent_severity: DiagnosticSeverity,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum CallSiteDefault {
    End,
    Start,
}

impl Default for CrossFileConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            max_backward_depth: 10,      // Requirement 11.1
            max_forward_depth: 10,       // Requirement 11.2
            max_chain_depth: 20,         // Requirement 11.3
            assume_call_site: CallSiteDefault::End, // Requirement 11.4
            index_workspace: true,       // Requirement 11.5
            max_revalidations_per_trigger: 10, // Requirement 11.6
            revalidation_debounce_ms: 200,     // Requirement 11.7
            undefined_variables_enabled: true, // Requirement 11.9
            missing_file_severity: DiagnosticSeverity::WARNING,
            circular_dependency_severity: DiagnosticSeverity::ERROR,
            out_of_scope_severity: DiagnosticSeverity::WARNING,
            ambiguous_parent_severity: DiagnosticSeverity::WARNING,
        }
    }
}

/// Configuration change handling (Requirement 11.11)
/// When configuration changes, the LSP must re-resolve scope chains for all open documents.
pub fn on_configuration_changed(state: &mut WorldState, new_config: CrossFileConfig) {
    let old_config = std::mem::replace(&mut state.cross_file_config, new_config);
    
    // If scope-affecting settings changed, invalidate all scope caches
    if old_config.assume_call_site != state.cross_file_config.assume_call_site
        || old_config.max_chain_depth != state.cross_file_config.max_chain_depth
        || old_config.max_backward_depth != state.cross_file_config.max_backward_depth
        || old_config.max_forward_depth != state.cross_file_config.max_forward_depth
    {
        // Invalidate all scope caches
        state.cross_file_cache.invalidate_all();
        
        // Schedule diagnostics revalidation for all open documents
        let open_docs: Vec<Url> = state.documents.keys().cloned().collect();
        for uri in open_docs {
            state.cross_file_revalidation.schedule(uri);
        }
    }
}
```


### Cache Structures (Versioned)

Caches must be versioned/fingerprinted so concurrent edits cannot reuse stale cross-file state.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use tower_lsp::lsp_types::Url;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct ScopeFingerprint {
    /// Hash of the file's own contents (or doc version mapped to a hash).
    pub self_hash: u64,

    /// Hash of the dependency edge set used (including call-site lines and semantics-bearing edge fields).
    pub edges_hash: u64,

    /// Hash of upstream exported interfaces / upstream scope artifacts used.
    pub upstream_interfaces_hash: u64,

    /// Workspace index version to prevent stale reuse across index updates.
    pub workspace_index_version: u64,
}

pub struct MetadataCache {
    cache: HashMap<Url, CrossFileMetadata>,
}

pub struct ArtifactsCache {
    cache: HashMap<Url, (ScopeFingerprint, ScopeArtifacts)>,
}

impl ArtifactsCache {
    pub fn get_if_fresh(&self, uri: &Url, fp: &ScopeFingerprint) -> Option<ScopeArtifacts>;
    pub fn insert(&mut self, uri: Url, fp: ScopeFingerprint, artifacts: ScopeArtifacts);
    pub fn invalidate(&mut self, uri: &Url);
}
```

Implementation notes:
- The simplest correct approach is to compute `self_hash` from document text.
- For performance, add Sight-like interface hashing: dependents only invalidate when `interface_hash` or edge set changes.

### Closed File Staleness Model (Required)

For files that are not currently open, the system needs a clear policy for when cached data is valid.

```rust
/// Snapshot metadata for a closed file, used to determine cache validity.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct FileSnapshot {
    /// File modification time (from filesystem metadata)
    pub mtime: SystemTime,
    /// File size in bytes
    pub size: u64,
    /// Optional content hash (computed on first read, cached)
    pub content_hash: Option<u64>,
}

impl FileSnapshot {
    /// Create snapshot from filesystem metadata
    pub fn from_metadata(metadata: &std::fs::Metadata) -> Self {
        Self {
            mtime: metadata.modified().unwrap_or(SystemTime::UNIX_EPOCH),
            size: metadata.len(),
            content_hash: None,
        }
    }
    
    /// Check if this snapshot matches current disk state
    pub fn matches_disk(&self, current: &FileSnapshot) -> bool {
        self.mtime == current.mtime && self.size == current.size
    }
}
```

**Validity Policy:**
1. Index entries are valid only if their `FileSnapshot` matches current disk metadata (or matches "last watched version" if maintained).
2. On `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`, invalidate entries where snapshot no longer matches.
3. On scope resolution for a closed file:
   - Check if index entry exists and snapshot is fresh
   - If fresh, use cached `ScopeArtifacts`
   - If stale or missing, read from disk via `CrossFileFileCache`, update index entry


### Extended WorldState

Rlsp already protects `WorldState` behind an async lock at the server boundary (`Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<WorldState>>`). This is a *good* fit for cross-file awareness: it enables concurrent read access from request handlers while serializing mutation.

Key rule: **Never spawn background work that holds a borrowed `&mut WorldState`**. Background tasks must reacquire a fresh lock and must guard against publishing stale results.

#### Document Versioning (Required)

To support concurrent editing and to prevent publishing stale diagnostics:
- Each open `Document` MUST store the LSP `TextDocumentItem.version` (monotonic per document while open).
- Any debounced/background diagnostics task MUST capture a trigger version (or content hash) and MUST re-check it before publishing.
- If the document is no longer open, tasks MUST no-op.

#### Diagnostics Publish Gating (Required)

To prevent stale diagnostic publishes when multiple triggers race (e.g., cross-file invalidation + user edits), the server MUST enforce monotonic publishing per URI.

Minimum requirement:
- Track `last_published_version[uri]`.
- Never publish diagnostics for `document.version` if it is `< last_published_version[uri]`.
- Provide a "force republish" mechanism for dependency-triggered revalidation where the document version may be unchanged but scope/diagnostic inputs changed. (Sight uses a `clear_published_version`-style mechanism.)

```rust
/// Extended WorldState with cross-file support
pub struct WorldState {
    // Existing fields
    pub documents: HashMap<Url, Document>,
    pub workspace_folders: Vec<Url>,
    pub library: Library,
    pub workspace_index: HashMap<Url, Document>,
    pub workspace_imports: Vec<String>,
    pub help_cache: HelpCache,

    // Cross-file state (mutated under the server's async write lock)
    pub cross_file_config: CrossFileConfig,
    pub cross_file_meta: MetadataCache,
    pub cross_file_graph: DependencyGraph,
    pub cross_file_cache: ArtifactsCache,

    // Workspace/disk cache for closed files (used by scope resolution)
    pub cross_file_file_cache: CrossFileFileCache,

    // Revalidation bookkeeping (debounce/cancellation keyed by URI)
    pub cross_file_revalidation: CrossFileRevalidationState,

    // Client activity hints (optional but supported by the VS Code extension)
    // Used only for prioritization; never affects correctness.
    pub cross_file_activity: CrossFileActivityState,

    // Diagnostics publish gating / forced republish bookkeeping
    pub cross_file_diagnostics_gate: CrossFileDiagnosticsGate,

    // Workspace index integration (required)
    pub cross_file_workspace_index: CrossFileWorkspaceIndex,
}

/// Tracks client activity hints for revalidation prioritization (Requirement 15)
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct CrossFileActivityState {
    /// Currently active document URI (if any)
    pub active_uri: Option<Url>,
    /// Currently visible document URIs
    pub visible_uris: Vec<Url>,
    /// Timestamp of last activity update (for ordering)
    pub timestamp_ms: u64,
    /// Most recently changed/opened URIs (fallback ordering)
    pub recent_uris: Vec<Url>,

Notes:
- `cross_file_file_cache` is the disk-backed cache used when resolving files that are not currently open.
- `cross_file_workspace_index` is maintained via file watching and is used to keep closed-file information fresh and to reduce disk IO.


### Real-Time Cross-File Update System (Requirement 0)

The real-time update system ensures diagnostics, completions, hover, and definitions stay correct across all affected open files when any file in the chain is edited.

#### Trigger Model (Diagnostics Fanout)

When a document changes (in-memory `didOpen`/`didChange` *or* on-disk `didChangeWatchedFiles`):
1. **Metadata Update**: Extract `CrossFileMetadata` (directives + detected `source()` calls + working directory).
2. **Graph Update**: Update `DependencyGraph` edges for the changed file.
3. **Change Detection**: Compute whether the semantics-bearing exported interface hash or edge set changed.
4. **Selective Invalidation**: If interface/edges changed, invalidate scope caches for all transitive dependents.
5. **Diagnostics Fanout**: Schedule diagnostics recomputation for affected **open** documents.
6. **Cancellation**: Cancel any outdated pending revalidations for the same files.
7. **Freshness Guard (required)**: Before publishing diagnostics from a background task, verify the document version/hash still matches the triggering version/hash; otherwise do not publish.

#### Debouncing and Cancellation

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
use tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken;

/// Tracks pending revalidation work per file
pub struct CrossFileRevalidationState {
    /// Pending revalidation tasks keyed by URI
    pending: HashMap<Url, CancellationToken>,
    /// Debounce delay in milliseconds
    debounce_ms: u64,

    /// Max number of open documents to schedule per trigger.
    max_revalidations_per_trigger: usize,
}

impl CrossFileRevalidationState {
    pub fn new(debounce_ms: u64, max_revalidations_per_trigger: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            pending: HashMap::new(),
            debounce_ms,
            max_revalidations_per_trigger,
        }
    }

    /// Schedule revalidation for a file, cancelling any pending work
    pub fn schedule(&mut self, uri: Url) -> CancellationToken {
        // Cancel existing pending work for this URI
        if let Some(old_token) = self.pending.remove(&uri) {
            old_token.cancel();
        }
        
        let token = CancellationToken::new();
        self.pending.insert(uri, token.clone());
        token
    }

    /// Mark revalidation as complete
    pub fn complete(&mut self, uri: &Url) {
        self.pending.remove(uri);
    }
}
```


#### Revalidation Flow

    // 2. Update dependency graph
    state.cross_file_graph.update_file(changed_uri, &new_meta);

// 3. Compute if interface or edges changed (semantics-bearing)
    let old_hash = old_meta.as_ref().map(|m| compute_interface_hash(m));
    let new_hash = compute_interface_hash(&new_meta);

### Multiple Source Calls and Ambiguous Parents

#### Multiple Source Calls at Different Call Sites (Requirement 5.9)

When a file is sourced multiple times at different call sites in the same parent, symbol availability MUST use full `(line, column)` ordering.

```rust
/// Resolve the effective call site when a file is sourced multiple times.
///
/// Returns the earliest call site position using lexicographic ordering:
/// `(l1, c1) < (l2, c2)` iff `l1 < l2 || (l1 == l2 && c1 < c2)`.
pub fn resolve_multiple_source_calls(
    sources: &[ForwardSource],
    target_path: &str,
) -> Option<(u32, u32)> {
    // Find all source calls to the same target
    let calls: Vec<_> = sources
        .iter()
        .filter(|s| s.path == target_path)
        .collect();

    match calls.len() {
        0 => None,
        1 => Some((calls[0].line, calls[0].column)),
        _ => {
            // Multiple calls: use the earliest call site.
            // Symbols become available strictly after the first source() call.
            calls
                .iter()
                .map(|s| (s.line, s.column))
                .min()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Ambiguous Parents (Requirement 5.10)

When a file has multiple possible parents (multiple backward directives or multiple callers), selection MUST be deterministic and the precedence MUST be documented.

Precedence (highest to lowest):
1. Backward directive with explicit `line=`
2. Backward directive with explicit `match=`
3. Reverse-dependency edge (forward resolution) with known call site
4. Backward directive / reverse edge without call site (uses inference/default)
5. Deterministic tiebreak: lexicographic by URI

A warning diagnostic SHOULD be emitted when multiple viable parents exist.

```rust
/// Result of parent resolution
pub enum ParentResolution {
    /// Single unambiguous parent
    Single(Url, Option<u32>), // (parent_uri, call_site_line)
    /// Multiple possible parents - deterministic but ambiguous
    Ambiguous {
        selected: (Url, Option<u32>),
        alternatives: Vec<Url>,
    },
    /// No parent found
    None,
}
```


```rust
/// Resolve parent for a file with backward directives
pub fn resolve_parent(
    metadata: &CrossFileMetadata,
    graph: &DependencyGraph,
    uri: &Url,
    config: &CrossFileConfig,
) -> ParentResolution {
    // Collect all possible parents
    let mut parents: Vec<(Url, Option<u32>)> = Vec::new();
    
    // From backward directives
    for directive in &metadata.sourced_by {
        if let Some(parent_uri) = resolve_path(&directive.path, uri) {
            let call_site = match &directive.call_site {
                CallSiteSpec::Line(n) => Some(*n),
                CallSiteSpec::Match(pattern) => {
                    // Try to find matching line in parent
                    find_matching_line(&parent_uri, pattern)
                }
                CallSiteSpec::Default => None,
            };
            parents.push((parent_uri, call_site));
        }
    }
    
    // From reverse dependency edges (forward resolution found us)
    for edge in graph.get_dependents(uri) {
        if edge.kind == EdgeKind::Forward {
            let entry = (edge.from.clone(), edge.call_site_line);
            if !parents.iter().any(|(u, _)| u == &edge.from) {
                parents.push(entry);
            }
        }
    }
    
    match parents.len() {
        0 => ParentResolution::None,
        1 => ParentResolution::Single(parents[0].0.clone(), parents[0].1),
        _ => {
            // Deterministic selection: sort by URI string, take first
            parents.sort_by(|a, b| a.0.as_str().cmp(b.0.as_str()));
            let selected = parents.remove(0);
            let alternatives: Vec<Url> = parents.into_iter().map(|(u, _)| u).collect();
            ParentResolution::Ambiguous {
                selected: (selected.0, selected.1),
                alternatives,
            }
        }
    }
}
```


When ambiguity is detected, emit a diagnostic suggesting `line=` or `match=` to disambiguate:

```rust
/// Generate diagnostic for ambiguous parent
pub fn ambiguous_parent_diagnostic(
    directive_line: u32,
    selected: &Url,
    alternatives: &[Url],
) -> Diagnostic {
    let alt_list = alternatives.iter()
        .map(|u| u.path())
        .collect::<Vec<_>>()
        .join(", ");
    
    Diagnostic {
        range: line_range(directive_line),
        severity: Some(DiagnosticSeverity::WARNING),
        message: format!(
            "Ambiguous parent: using '{}' but also found: {}. \
             Consider adding line= or match= to disambiguate.",
            selected.path(),
            alt_list
        ),
        ..Default::default()
    }
}
```

## Data Models

### Cross-file metadata

See **Unified Cross-File Metadata Model (Single Source of Truth)** above (`CrossFileMetadata`). That representation is the only directive/source data model.

### Position-aware scope artifacts

Cross-file scope is position-aware. The stable "unit of sharing" across files is a file's **exported interface** plus an **interface hash** used for invalidation.

```rust
/// The hashable surface a file exposes to dependents.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ExportedInterface {
    pub symbols: HashMap<String, ScopedSymbol>,
    pub interface_hash: u64,
}

/// A computed scope at a line in a file.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ScopeAtLine {
    pub symbols: HashMap<String, ScopedSymbol>,
    pub chain: Vec<Url>,
    pub errors: Vec<ScopeError>,
}
```


## Correctness Properties

*A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system—essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.*

### Property 1: Backward Directive Synonym Equivalence

*For any* valid path string, parsing `# @lsp-sourced-by <path>`, `# @lsp-run-by <path>`, and `# @lsp-included-by <path>` SHALL produce equivalent `BackwardDirective` structures with the same path.

**Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3**

### Property 2: Working Directory Synonym Equivalence

*For any* valid path string, parsing `# @lsp-working-directory <path>`, `# @lsp-wd <path>`, `# @lsp-cd <path>`, and `# @lsp-current-directory <path>` SHALL produce equivalent working directory configurations.

**Validates: Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4**

### Property 3: Quote Style Equivalence for Source Detection

*For any* valid path string `p`, detecting `source("p")` and `source('p')` SHALL produce equivalent `SourceCall` structures with the same path.

**Validates: Requirements 4.1, 4.2**

### Property 4: Local Symbol Precedence

*For any* scope chain where a symbol `s` is defined in both a sourced file and the current file, the resolved scope SHALL contain the current file's definition of `s`, and completions, hover, and go-to-definition SHALL use the local definition.

**Validates: Requirements 5.4, 7.3, 8.3, 9.2, 9.3**

### Property 5: Diagnostic Suppression

*For any* file containing `# @lsp-ignore` on line `n`, no diagnostics SHALL be emitted for line `n`. *For any* file containing `# @lsp-ignore-next` on line `n`, no diagnostics SHALL be emitted for line `n+1`.

**Validates: Requirements 2.2, 2.3, 10.4, 10.5**

### Property 6: Missing File Diagnostics

*For any* directive or source() call referencing a non-existent file path, the Diagnostic_Engine SHALL emit exactly one warning diagnostic at the location of that reference.

Clarification: "exactly one" means a single diagnostic per (file, line, referenced path) tuple. If the same missing path is referenced multiple times at different lines, each reference may produce its own diagnostic.

**Validates: Requirements 1.8, 2.5, 10.2**

### Property 7: Circular Dependency Detection

*For any* set of files where file A sources file B and file B sources file A (directly or transitively), the Scope_Resolver SHALL detect the cycle, break it, and emit an error diagnostic listing the cycle.

**Validates: Requirements 5.7, 10.6**

### Property 8: Directive Round-Trip Serialization

*For any* valid `CrossFileMetadata` structure, serializing to JSON and then deserializing SHALL produce an equivalent structure. This implies parsing is deterministic.

**Validates: Requirements 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4**

### Property 9: Call Site Line Parameter Extraction

*For any* backward directive with `line=N` parameter where N is a valid 1-based line number, the parsed `CallSiteSpec` SHALL be `Line(N-1)` (converted to 0-based) with the exact value.

**Validates: Requirements 1.4**

## Error Handling

### Critical Design Invariants

These invariants MUST be preserved across all refactoring. They are the core behaviors that make cross-file awareness work correctly during concurrent editing.

1. **Dependency-triggered revalidation MUST bypass "version didn't change" gating** while still respecting "don't publish older-than-last-published". This is the "force republish" behavior.

2. **Never use `futures::executor::block_on()` inside Tokio runtime** - always use async/await patterns to avoid deadlocks.

3. **Edge deduplication is semantic, not syntactic** - edges are deduplicated by `(to_uri, call_site_position, local, chdir, is_sys_source)`, not by provenance (directive vs AST).

4. **Open documents are always authoritative** - disk-backed caches MUST NOT overwrite in-memory state for open files.

5. **Parent resolution MUST be deterministic and stable** - even when some parents are temporarily missing (file deleted or not yet indexed), the same inputs MUST produce the same selected parent.

### Missing Files

When a directive or source() call references a non-existent file:
1. Emit a diagnostic at the reference location with configurable severity
2. Continue scope resolution, skipping the missing file
3. Do not propagate the error to dependent files

Deduplication requirement:
- The implementation MUST avoid emitting duplicate missing-file diagnostics for the same (file, line, referenced path) tuple when the same relationship is represented both as a directive and a detected `source()` call.

### Circular Dependencies

When a circular dependency is detected:
1. Emit an error diagnostic listing the cycle (e.g., "Circular dependency: A → B → C → A")
2. Break the cycle by not following the back-edge
3. Continue resolution with partial scope

### Parse Errors

When a directive has invalid syntax:
1. Log a trace message for debugging
2. Skip the malformed directive
3. Continue parsing remaining directives

### Path Resolution Failures

When a path cannot be resolved (e.g., invalid characters):
1. Emit a warning diagnostic
2. Skip the unresolvable path
3. Continue with remaining paths

### Maximum Depth Exceeded

When traversal exceeds configured maximum depth:
1. Emit an info diagnostic indicating truncation
2. Stop traversal at the limit
3. Return partial scope with available symbols

### Ambiguous Parents

When multiple parents are detected for a file:
1. Select a parent using the documented precedence order (explicit line/match first, then reverse edges, then deterministic tiebreak)
2. Emit a warning diagnostic suggesting `line=` or `match=` to disambiguate
3. Continue resolution with the selected parent


## Client Activity Signals (VS Code)

The VS Code extension can provide active/visible editor hints that enable better prioritization of cross-file revalidations (Requirement 15). These hints MUST NOT affect correctness; they only influence the order in which the server schedules work.

### Proposed Custom Notification

Method: `rlsp/activeDocumentsChanged`

Payload:
- `activeUri: string | null`
- `visibleUris: string[]`
- `timestampMs: number`

### Notification Payload Structure

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

/// Payload for rlsp/activeDocumentsChanged notification (Requirement 15.3)
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ActiveDocumentsChangedParams {
    /// The currently active document URI (or null if none)
    #[serde(rename = "activeUri")]
    pub active_uri: Option<String>,
    /// The set of currently visible document URIs
    #[serde(rename = "visibleUris")]
    pub visible_uris: Vec<String>,
    /// Client timestamp for ordering
    #[serde(rename = "timestampMs")]
    pub timestamp_ms: u64,
}
```

### Server Notification Handler

```rust
/// Handle rlsp/activeDocumentsChanged notification (Requirements 15.4, 15.5)
pub async fn handle_active_documents_changed(
    state: Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<WorldState>>,
    params: ActiveDocumentsChangedParams,
) {
    let mut st = state.write().await;
    
    // Convert string URIs to Url, filtering invalid ones
    let active_uri = params.active_uri
        .and_then(|s| Url::parse(&s).ok());
    let visible_uris: Vec<Url> = params.visible_uris
        .into_iter()
        .filter_map(|s| Url::parse(&s).ok())
        .collect();
    
    // Update activity state
    st.cross_file_activity.update(active_uri, visible_uris, params.timestamp_ms);
    
    log::trace!(
        "Updated activity state: active={:?}, visible_count={}",
        st.cross_file_activity.active_uri,
        st.cross_file_activity.visible_uris.len()
    );
}
```

### VS Code Extension Responsibilities

The extension SHOULD:
- send `rlsp/activeDocumentsChanged` when `vscode.window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` fires (Requirement 15.1)
- send `rlsp/activeDocumentsChanged` when `vscode.window.onDidChangeVisibleTextEditors` fires (Requirement 15.2)

### Server Responsibilities

The server SHALL:
- record last-seen activity timestamp per URI
- use these hints to prioritize revalidation scheduling: trigger first, then active, then visible, then other open
- ignore URIs that are not currently open in the server
- fall back to trigger-first + most-recently-changed ordering if client does not support these notifications (Requirement 15.5)

## Workspace Watching + Indexing (Required)

Cross-file awareness MUST remain correct when:
- a dependent file is edited but not currently open
- files are created/renamed/deleted on disk
- open documents have unsaved in-memory changes while related files change on disk

To achieve this, the server MUST implement workspace watcher + indexing integration similar to Sight.

### Authoritative Sources (Required)

1. If a file is currently open in the editor, its in-memory `Document` is authoritative.
2. If a file is not open, the system uses:
   - `cross_file_workspace_index` as the primary fast path for symbols/metadata, and
   - `cross_file_file_cache` (disk read) as a fallback and/or to refresh index entries.

Required watcher rule:
- On `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`, if the changed path corresponds to an open document, the server MUST invalidate disk-backed caches/index entries for that path but MUST NOT replace in-memory metadata/artifacts with disk-derived results for that file.

### Watch Registration

Register watched file patterns for relevant R project files (at minimum `**/*.R` and `**/*.r`, and optionally `**/*.Rprofile`, `**/*.Renviron`).

**LSP Registration Mechanics (Required):**

The server MUST register file watchers via dynamic registration (`client/registerCapability`) during the `initialized` handler:

```rust
/// Register file watchers for R files (called from initialized handler)
pub async fn register_file_watchers(client: &Client) -> Result<()> {
    let watchers = vec![
        FileSystemWatcher {
            glob_pattern: GlobPattern::String("**/*.R".to_string()),
            kind: Some(WatchKind::Create | WatchKind::Change | WatchKind::Delete),
        },
        FileSystemWatcher {
            glob_pattern: GlobPattern::String("**/*.r".to_string()),
            kind: Some(WatchKind::Create | WatchKind::Change | WatchKind::Delete),
        },
        FileSystemWatcher {
            glob_pattern: GlobPattern::String("**/*.Rprofile".to_string()),
            kind: Some(WatchKind::Create | WatchKind::Change | WatchKind::Delete),
        },
    ];
    
    let registration = Registration {
        id: "rlsp-file-watcher".to_string(),
        method: "workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles".to_string(),
        register_options: Some(serde_json::to_value(DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions {
            watchers,
        })?),
    };
    
    client.register_capability(vec![registration]).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

**Timing:**
- Registration MUST occur in the `initialized` handler (after `initialize` completes)
- The server MUST check `capabilities.workspace.didChangeWatchedFiles.dynamicRegistration` before attempting dynamic registration

**Fallback (if dynamic registration not supported):**
- If the client does not support dynamic registration, the server SHOULD:
  1. Rely on `textDocument/didOpen` and `textDocument/didClose` for open files
  2. Optionally implement periodic workspace rescanning (configurable, default off)
  3. Document this limitation in the extension README

### On File Changed/Created

1. Invalidate disk-backed `cross_file_file_cache` entries for that file.
2. Schedule a debounced workspace index update for that file in `cross_file_workspace_index`.
3. If the changed file participates in the dependency graph (as a node or an edge endpoint), update dependency edges (best-effort) and schedule diagnostics fanout for affected open documents.

Notes:
- Rename/move events may arrive as delete+create. The handler SHOULD treat these as independent events and allow the graph/index to converge after debounce.
- Canonicalization failures (e.g., path does not exist yet) MUST be handled gracefully: keep best-effort node identity but avoid panics.

### On File Deleted

1. Remove the file from the dependency graph (remove all edges involving it).
2. Invalidate caches that reference it.
3. Emit missing-file diagnostics for open documents that reference it (via directives or `source()` calls).

### Debounce + Yield

During bulk changes, the indexer MUST debounce and MUST yield between work items so the server remains responsive.

### Index Versioning

The workspace index MUST have a monotonically increasing version counter that increments on modifications so scope fingerprints can include `workspace_index_version` where appropriate.

### Workspace Index Contents (Required)

`CrossFileWorkspaceIndex` MUST store enough information for cross-file scope resolution and diagnostics without requiring every dependent file to be open:
- per-file extracted `CrossFileMetadata` (directives + resolvable forward sources)
- per-file `ScopeArtifacts` (at least `exported_interface`, `timeline`, and `interface_hash`)
- per-file bookkeeping: last indexed file timestamp/metadata (e.g., mtime + size) and last seen `workspace_index_version`

The index is not required to be fully consistent at every instant, but it MUST be monotonic and MUST converge quickly after filesystem change events.

### Disk File Cache (Required)

`CrossFileFileCache` is the IO layer for closed files. It MUST:
- read file contents from disk on-demand
- cache by absolute path and file metadata (e.g., mtime + size)
- be invalidated on `didChangeWatchedFiles`

Scope resolution for a closed file SHOULD use `CrossFileWorkspaceIndex` when fresh; otherwise it SHOULD refresh via `CrossFileFileCache` and update the index entry.
