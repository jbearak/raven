# Package database

Raven resolves the symbols a package exports so it can offer completions, hover, and — most importantly — avoid flagging every package function as an undefined variable. Normally it reads that information from the package as installed on your machine. But in CI there is often **no R and no installed packages**: `.libPaths()` is empty, so every `library(pkg)` would fire a missing-package warning and every symbol from a package would show as undefined. That makes Raven effectively unusable in CI.

The package database fixes this by giving Raven a pre-built source of export **names** that needs neither R nor installed packages at analysis time. Resolution becomes an **ordered fallback over three tiers**, consulted per package only when the package isn't already resolved.

## The three tiers

| Tier | When it applies | Source | Fidelity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Installed** | Package found in a local library path (R only affects `exportPattern` fidelity, not whether Tier 1 applies) | The existing on-disk path: static `NAMESPACE` parse (covering `export`, `exportMethods`, `exportClasses`, `S3method`, and the `exportPattern` / `exportClassPattern` markers) + an R subprocess to expand patterns (or the `INDEX` approximation when R is absent) | Authoritative, version-exact to the install |
| **2 — Repo DB** | No package directory found on disk (e.g. CI with an empty `.libPaths()`) | A repo-specific, committed `.raven/packages.json` you generate locally | "Frozen Tier 1": full structure, version-exact to when it was generated |
| **3 — Downloaded DB** | Otherwise (no Tier 1 directory and no Tier 2 record) | `names.db`: a reference-R capture ∪ CRAN + Bioconductor (via r-universe), merged **append-only** into a version-monotonic union. Not bundled with the binary; install it with `raven packages update` (or point `RAVEN_NAMES_DB` at your own copy). | Highest version per package; exports + `Depends` + datasets (no `:::`/signatures) |

The fallback trigger is a **missing package directory**, never a missing R: the tiers below Tier 1 are consulted only when the package isn't found on disk at all. A package that *is* installed still resolves from Tier 1 even with no R — its `exportPattern` exports just degrade to the `INDEX` approximation. **Tier 2 outranks Tier 3** because it is project-specific and built through the authoritative path. A repo that never generates a Tier 2 file can still work in CI via Tier 3 alone once `raven packages update` has installed the `names.db` database into the user-data directory. Without it, installs still have embedded base R-platform coverage, but not broad CRAN/Bioconductor Tier 3 coverage. The two databases share one in-memory model, one reader, and one writer.

The tiers are a **floor, never a replacement**: whenever a package resolves from a real local install (Tier 1), that path stays in charge and is version-exact. Nothing here regresses behavior when packages *are* installed.

> **Export names, not install status.** The database suppresses undefined-variable noise; it never makes a package count as *installed*. The missing-package diagnostic stays Tier-1-only and is **off by default in `raven check`**. See [Names vs. install status](#names-vs-install-status) below.

### Exports completeness

Each cached `PackageInfo` records how *complete* its export set is — the signal the [`namespace-member-not-found`](diagnostics.md#namespace-member-references-pkgmember) diagnostic uses to decide whether absence is conclusive:

| Completeness | Source | Member absence |
|---|---|---|
| **Complete** | static `NAMESPACE` parse without `exportPattern()`/`exportClassPattern()`; R's `getNamespaceExports()`; a Tier 2/3 provider record; the embedded base table | Conclusive — a `pkg::member` not in the set is reported |
| **Partial** | the `INDEX` approximation (used when R is absent for an `exportPattern()` package) | Never concluded — `INDEX` lists only documented topics |
| **Unknown** | not yet warmed, or unresolvable without R | Never concluded |

The member authority (`namespace_member_status_sync`) is **synchronous, never spawns R, and never touches disk**: it consults the warmed cache, then the providers, and concludes `Absent` only from a `Complete` set. A package referenced via `pkg::` is warmed into the cache in the background, so until that warm completes the authority returns `Unknown` (silent) — it deliberately does not parse the on-disk `NAMESPACE` synchronously, which would block the keystroke path and could not see datasets. Data objects (`lazy_data`, the per-file `data_aliases` object names, and base-package datasets via `base_exports`) are **positive-only** — they confirm a member is present but never prove one absent.

The cache write path (`insert_package`) is **monotonically authoritative**: once a package is cached `Complete`, a later weaker (`Partial`/`Unknown`) load can never downgrade its exports or completeness — it only ever folds in additional positive-only data. This keeps a transient R-less reload from turning a previously-conclusive export set back into "don't know."

## Tier 2 — the committed `.raven/packages.json`

A repo-specific snapshot, generated on a machine that has R and the project's packages installed, and **committed to the repo**. Because it is produced through Raven's authoritative path, it is effectively *frozen Tier 1*: it captures the full structure — exports (with `exportPattern` correctly expanded), `Depends`, datasets, and meta-package attaches.

**Why generate one at all?** Tier 2 is the reproducible, project-specific path: commit `.raven/packages.json` when CI should use package metadata captured from the versions your project actually installed. Tier 3 is broad ecosystem coverage, but its database is absent until `raven packages update` runs, and its mutable `names-db` Release is not version-pinned by your project. A Tier 2 file makes diagnostics *more accurate* in two cases: (1) your repo uses packages whose exports **aren't present** in Raven's Tier 3 database (GitHub-only, internal, or not-yet-indexed packages), and (2) you pin package versions whose exports **differ** from the versions Tier 3 captured, in ways that could change diagnostics (the [drift caveat](#fidelity-caveats) below). If neither accuracy case applies, Tier 3's database is present, and you do not need project-pinned reproducibility, Tier 3 alone is enough and you don't need to run `freeze`.

- **Opt-in.** It exists only if you run the generation command; Raven never auto-creates it.
- **Location.** `.raven/packages.json` at the repo root, auto-discovered like `raven.toml` / `.lintr`.
- **Format.** Sorted, deterministic, diff-friendly JSON — generated, **not hand-edited**, and meant to be reviewed in PRs, so a `git diff` reads as "package Y gained export X." Each record also stores the package **version**, so a dependency bump reads as "dplyr 1.1.0 → 1.1.4."
- **Provenance.** Records the generator Raven version, the R version, and the generation date — for debuggability only. There is **no drift-detection machinery**: no lockfile-hash comparison and no "snapshot is stale" diagnostic. Export names are stable; regeneration is a manual command you run when you choose.

### Generating it

```bash
raven packages freeze
```

In VS Code, the same generation runs from the command palette as **Raven: Generate Package Database for CI** — one implementation, two entry points. See [`raven packages freeze`](cli.md#raven-packages-freeze) for all options. Generation resolves each package from a **renv-first** library order (the renv project library first, system libraries only for what renv doesn't cover), so "renv wins, system fills the gaps" happens automatically.

The default `--used` scope is **maximally inclusive** — over-inclusion is free, because the capture simply skips anything not actually installed. The "used" set is:

- packages referenced via `library`/`require`/`loadNamespace`/`requireNamespace`, **∪**
- the left-hand side of `::` / `:::` references, **∪**
- everything listed in `renv.lock`, **∪**
- the repo's own `DESCRIPTION` `Depends` / `Imports`, **∪**
- their transitive `Depends`.

(`LinkingTo` is excluded — it is C-level and has no R exports. For a `:::` reference, the *package's exports* are still frozen; only the internal-object names are out of scope.) Use `--installed` / `--all` to capture every package across the renv + system libraries instead.

`freeze` skips only the default-attached **Base-7** packages that Raven treats as always in scope with no `library()` call. It may still write records for non-attached base-priority packages such as `grid`, `tools`, and `compiler` when your code uses them or when you choose `--installed` / `--all`. That is intentional: `freeze` captures your local R install, which may differ from the reference R used to build Raven's embedded fallback, and the generated file should match packages you explicitly call in scripts.

`renv.lock` is a **set selector** — it decides *which* packages to include (a locked package is included even if no script calls it), **not** which version to read; exports always come from whatever is installed locally. A locked package that isn't installed can't be captured and falls through to Tier 3 in CI. Best coverage therefore comes from generating after `renv::restore()`, but nothing breaks otherwise.

### Regeneration is a no-op when unchanged

If a `.raven/packages.json` already exists, `freeze` compares **package content only** (ignoring provenance such as the timestamp). When the content is identical it leaves the file untouched and prints "no changes" — so a regeneration that found nothing new produces a **zero-line diff**, and the provenance timestamp moves only when the captured exports actually changed.

### Two producers, one artifact

The Tier 2 `.raven/packages.json` has two producers — the three resolution tiers are unchanged:

- **`raven packages freeze`** — sources exports from a local R install. Version-exact, deterministic, meant to be committed and reviewed in PRs. The reproducible, project-pinned path.
- **`raven packages fetch`** — sources exports from CRAN/Bioconductor r-universe (`cran.r-universe.dev`, `bioc.r-universe.dev`). Needs no R, no installed packages, and no dependency on the `names-db` Release. Fetches **latest** exports only (r-universe does not archive old versions), so it is not version-pinned. The file is an ephemeral CI artifact meant to be regenerated each run and gitignored rather than committed.

Both write the same schema (v1) and are consumed through the same reader — `raven check` and the language server cannot distinguish them. `fetch` is strictly **additive**: it reads any existing file at the target, preserves every record untouched, and adds records only for used packages not already present. Run after `freeze`, it tops up coverage for whatever `freeze` missed (e.g. uninstalled packages) without disturbing a single `freeze` row.

**renv.lock version-skew heads-up.** Because r-universe is latest-only, `fetch` cannot pull the exact version `renv.lock` pins. When the fetched version differs from the locked version, `fetch` prints a warning naming both. Export names are usually stable across versions, so this is informational — never an error.

**Scope limits.** `fetch` covers only the project's used set — it does not replace Tier 3's zero-adoption, whole-ecosystem floor. And base/recommended packages are not on r-universe; they still come from local R or the embedded fallback at analysis time.

See [`raven packages fetch`](cli.md#raven-packages-fetch) and [Four ways to run `raven check` in CI](cli.md#four-ways-to-run-raven-check-in-ci) for usage and the full strategy comparison.

### Version skew is explained, not silently dropped

If a committed `.raven/packages.json` was written by a **newer** Raven than the one reading it (an incompatible schema), Raven does not silently ignore it. It **explains and continues**: `raven check` prints a specific note to stderr, the language server raises a notification, and resolution degrades to Tier 3 when a usable database is available. The message tells you to upgrade Raven here or regenerate the file with `raven packages freeze`. An unreadable or corrupt file is reported the same way. A missing file is normal and silent.

## Tier 3 — `names.db` database

A latest-CRAN/Bioc package symbol database — the R-free floor for broad ecosystem coverage when the database is installed. Coverage for R's base-priority packages is **embedded directly in the binary** — no separate database file needed for them. Raven embeds all 14 base-priority packages, but only the default-attached **Base-7** (`base`, `methods`, `utils`, `grDevices`, `graphics`, `stats`, `datasets`) are always in scope; the other 7 (compiler, grid, parallel, splines, stats4, tcltk, tools) resolve from the embedded table only after an explicit `library()` call. `names.db`'s post-merge filter strips **all 14 base-priority packages** (everything embedded in the binary), so it never re-supplies base symbols; it covers CRAN, Bioconductor, and recommended packages only. `names.db` is **not** bundled with the binary — install it with `raven packages update` (or point `RAVEN_NAMES_DB` at your own copy); the floor is a single database file.

- **Source.** An authoritative **reference-R capture of the build machine's entire installed library** (via Raven's Tier-1 path) **∪** **CRAN + Bioconductor** from [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev) (`cran.r-universe.dev` and `bioc.r-universe.dev`). r-universe's `_exports` is the *true post-load namespace export set* — `exportPattern()` already expanded — for the whole ecosystem. The sources are merged **append-only and monotonically**: each rebuild **seeds from the previous database by default**, merges in the reference-R capture and r-universe, and **never drops** a package. When more than one source carries a package, the merge keeps the record with the **highest version** — comparing all three (the prior database, the build machine's install, and the latest CRAN/Bioc) — so a package is never moved to an older export set: a newer CRAN/Bioc release overrides an older installed copy, a newer local build overrides an older CRAN release, and a still-newer version already in the database is kept. (Each record stores its package version for this comparison.)
- **Why the full installed library.** Hard-to-install, GitHub-only, internal, or fallback-built packages are absent from CRAN/Bioc and only ever enter the floor through the reference-R capture; append-only guarantees they're never lost on later rebuilds. The maintainer **bootstraps** the floor once from a richly-provisioned machine, after which automated runs seed from it and append. Teams can likewise build a private `names.db` from their own library for richer in-house coverage (point Raven at it with `RAVEN_NAMES_DB`).
- **Contents.** Export names + `Depends` + dataset names. **Export-only** — no internal (`:::`) objects, no signatures.
- **Delivery.** A database file downloaded with [`raven packages update`](cli.md#raven-packages-update) into Raven's user data directory (override the location with the `RAVEN_NAMES_DB` environment variable). It is **not** bundled with the binary, **not** compiled into it (which would bloat it), and **not** committed to git. It lives on a **GitHub Release** (a moving `names-db` tag) — a durable URL, unlike a per-run CI artifact — alongside its checksums.
- **Integrity & provenance.** The build records its source, snapshot date, package count, and Raven version in the database header, plus a [`blake3`](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) checksum of the payload that is verified when the file is opened. Bundling third-party data carries supply-chain responsibility, so provenance and a tamper check are part of the pipeline.
- **Freshness.** Equals Raven's release/refresh cadence — a rebuild on each release plus on-demand rebuilds; the **exact refresh interval is not yet committed**. Acceptable because the database tracks the latest CRAN/Bioc and export names are stable; append-only means coverage only ever grows.
- **Growth bound.** Because the merge is append-only, `names.db` grows monotonically — but slowly: at CRAN's ~2k-packages-per-year rate the file gains only ~1.7 MB/year, so a ~20–25 MB database is still well under ~40 MB a decade out. Names-only storage keeps the bound comfortable; no pruning is planned.

A stale or corrupt `names.db` (for example a custom `RAVEN_NAMES_DB` from an incompatible Raven) is **explained and skipped**, exactly like a version-skewed Tier 2 file — Raven never hard-fails over it.

### Data source and acknowledgement

The CRAN/Bioconductor portion of `names.db` is built from [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev), the package-build and metadata service maintained by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/r-universe/) (with support from the R Consortium, the Moore Foundation, and Google Season of Docs). We gratefully acknowledge that work. To minimize load on their infrastructure, the build fetches **one bulk `/api/dbdump` per universe** — the metadata-dump endpoint r-universe documents for exactly this purpose — rather than crawling packages individually, identifies itself with a descriptive `User-Agent`, and runs on no more than a weekly cadence to stay a light, courteous consumer of a free community service. See [`scripts/build-names-db.sh`](../scripts/build-names-db.sh) and the [Tier 3 build pipeline](development.md#tier-3-build-pipeline).

## Base packages and datasets

Base and recommended packages (**base**, **methods**, **utils**, **stats**, **datasets**, …) are normally read from your R installation. In CI without R they aren't on disk, so Raven falls back to the **embedded base table** compiled into the binary — a `// @generated` per-package record for all 14 of R's base-priority packages. Only the default-attached **Base-7** (`base`, `methods`, `utils`, `grDevices`, `graphics`, `stats`, `datasets`) are always in scope; the other 7 (compiler, grid, parallel, splines, stats4, tcltk, tools) sit in the per-package cache so `library(grid)` and friends resolve offline once explicitly loaded. This embedded table is the floor for base symbols; no database file is needed for base coverage. Recommended packages (such as **MASS**, **Matrix**, **survival**, …) are not embedded — they remain in `names.db` and resolve via Tier 3 when the database is present. Base **datasets** — `mtcars`, `iris`, and the like — are resolved via the embedded `datasets` records, so they resolve in CI too. A real R install still wins: these fallbacks are only consulted when the base packages aren't found locally.

**Non-base package datasets** (e.g. `flights` from **nycflights13**, `diamonds` from **ggplot2**) are captured as a `lazy_data` list in every tier's records and folded into the resolvable set when the package's exports are collected, so they resolve in CI with no extra work here.

How the dataset list is assembled at capture time (Tier 1 or Tier 2 generation) depends on the package:

- **LazyData packages** (`DESCRIPTION` sets `LazyData: true`; identifiable by `data/Rdata.rdb`) build a binary database of all data objects, so their `data/` file stems alone don't give a complete or authoritative list. For these packages Raven queries the R subprocess — `data(package = "pkg")$results` — to enumerate the dataset object names. Without R, the static file-stem walk is used as a fallback (reduced fidelity; a package like **survival** may be missing unlisted datasets like `lung`).
- **Non-LazyData packages** store individual `.rda`/`.RData` files in `data/`. Raven collects dataset names by walking those files and the `INDEX` file — no subprocess needed.

`raven packages build-shipped-db` also routes through this path: its Tier 3 reference-R capture (always on) picks up authoritative dataset lists for LazyData packages when R is available at build time.

## Names vs. install status

Knowing a package's exports is deliberately **separate** from knowing whether it is installed:

- **Export resolution** (suppresses undefined-variable noise) uses all three tiers, in every mode.
- **Install status** (drives the *missing-package* diagnostic) is **Tier 1 only** — it reflects what is present in the local library paths, never the database.

In CI, `raven check` **suppresses missing-package warnings by default** (CI deliberately omits installation); re-enable them with [`--report-uninstalled`](cli.md#missing-package-reporting-in-ci), which reports `library()` calls not present in the local library paths — *not* relative to the database. One consequence is an **accepted gap**: a genuine typo such as `library(dpylr)` is silent by default — no tier knows it, but `raven check` isn't checking install status — and surfaces only under `--report-uninstalled`. The full per-mode behavior and this gap are documented in [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md#package-names-vs-install-status).

## Fidelity caveats

- **`exportPattern` → solved.** r-universe `_exports` is the post-load truth, so the minority of packages whose exports require a built-and-loaded namespace are correct, including the `.onLoad` ∩ pattern corner. Tier 2, generated via `asNamespace()`, is equally correct.
- **S4 export directives (`exportMethods` / `exportClasses` / `exportClassPattern`).** The static Tier-1 NAMESPACE parse recognizes S4 generics/methods (`exportMethods`) and exported class names (`exportClasses`) as plain exports, matching `getNamespaceExports()`. This matters for S4-heavy packages (e.g. the retiring spatial stack `sp` / `maptools` / `rgeos`) that export symbols *only* via these directives and have no `exportPattern`: without this they would otherwise take the static path, never consult R, and surface false-positive `undefined-variable` for symbols like `spTransform`/`spRbind`. `exportClassPattern` is treated like `exportPattern` (R/`INDEX` expansion); when R is absent its `INDEX` expansion is best-effort, the same soft limitation `exportPattern` already carries.
- **Tier 3 tracks the latest CRAN/Bioc as of Raven's last database refresh.** For source/Cargo installs, that broad coverage is present only after `raven packages update` or a manually installed database file. Two soft drifts follow: (a) a just-removed export may linger until the next rebuild; (b) if your project uses a **newer** version of a package than Tier 3 captured, a symbol added in that newer version is unknown to Tier 3 and can surface as a **false-positive undefined-variable** diagnostic. Both are rare and soft — a project that needs exactness pins it via Tier 2 (`raven packages freeze`), which reads exports from the version actually installed.
- **Exports + `Depends` + datasets only.** Tiers 2 and 3 carry no `:::` internal objects and no function signatures (`formals`); those still come only from a local install (Tier 1/2 from a machine with the package). Signatures stay R-subprocess-only.
- **Bioconductor cadence** differs from CRAN, so the Tier 3 snapshot may not match a project's Bioc release train. Tier 2 covers projects that need exactness.
