# Smart Indentation

Raven provides intelligent indentation for R code through a two-tier system.

## Overview

Both tiers are active by default — no configuration needed.

| Tier | What It Does | How It Works |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Tier 1** | Basic indentation for pipes, operators, brackets | Declarative regex rules in VS Code's language configuration |
| **Tier 2** | AST-aware indentation with style-specific alignment | LSP `onTypeFormatting` via tree-sitter |

When you press Enter, Tier 1 applies first (regex-based), then Tier 2 replaces the result with a more precise indentation computed from the AST. If Tier 2 is disabled, Tier 1's result stands.

## How It Works

1. You press Enter in an R file
2. VS Code applies Tier 1 rules (basic regex indentation)
3. Raven's LSP analyzes the tree-sitter AST at your cursor position
4. The LSP returns a TextEdit that replaces the indentation with the correct amount
5. Your cursor lands at the precise column for your code style

## Configuration

### Indentation Style

```json
{
  "raven.indentation.style": "rstudio"
}
```

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"rstudio"` | (Default) Same-line arguments align to opening paren; next-line arguments indent from function line |
| `"rstudio-minus"` | All arguments indent from previous line, regardless of paren position |
| `"off"` | Disables Tier 2; only Tier 1 declarative rules remain active |

Style names follow the [ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics)](https://ess.r-project.org/) conventions: `rstudio` matches the RStudio IDE's default alignment; `rstudio-minus` (`RStudio-` in ESS) drops same-line paren alignment.

### Disabling Tier 2

Two ways to disable AST-aware indentation:

1. Set `raven.indentation.style` to `"off"` — the LSP returns no edits, Tier 1 still works
2. Set `editor.formatOnType` to `false` for R — VS Code won't send `onTypeFormatting` requests at all

The difference: `"off"` is a Raven setting that keeps `formatOnType` available for other languages. Disabling `formatOnType` is a VS Code editor setting that affects all languages (unless overridden per-language).

Raven sets `editor.formatOnType` to `true` for R files as a default. This is the lowest-priority setting in VS Code — if you explicitly set `editor.formatOnType` to `false` (globally or for `[r]`), your setting takes precedence.

## Styles

### RStudio Style (Default)

When the opening parenthesis is followed by content on the same line, continuation arguments align to the column after the paren:

```r
result <- function_call(first_arg,
                        second_arg,
                        third_arg)
```

When the opening parenthesis is followed by a newline, arguments indent by one level from the function line:

```r
result <- function_call(
  first_arg,
  second_arg,
  third_arg
)
```

### RStudio-Minus Style

All arguments indent from the previous line, regardless of where the opening paren is:

```r
result <- function_call(first_arg,
  second_arg,
  third_arg)
```

## Examples

### Pipe Chains

All continuation lines in a pipe chain align relative to the chain start:

```r
result <- data %>%
  filter(x > 0) %>%
  mutate(y = x * 2) %>%
  select(y)
```

### Nested Pipes in Function Calls

```r
output <- some_function(
  data %>%
    filter(x > 0) %>%
    select(y),
  other_arg
)
```

### Function Calls in Pipe Chains

```r
result <- data %>%
  mutate(new_col = complex_function(arg1,
                                    arg2,
                                    arg3)) %>%
  filter(new_col > 0)
```

### Brace Blocks

```r
if (condition) {
  do_something()
  do_something_else()
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Indentation not working at all

1. Check that you're editing an R file (`.R` extension)
2. Verify Raven is running (check VS Code's status bar)
3. Reload VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"

### Wrong indentation style

1. Check `raven.indentation.style` — valid values are `"rstudio"`, `"rstudio-minus"`, `"off"`
2. Reload VS Code after changing the setting

### Indentation looks doubled

Tier 2 replaces Tier 1's indentation, so doubling shouldn't happen. If it does, check for conflicting R extensions that also handle `onTypeFormatting`.

### Pipe chains not aligning correctly

Tier 2 detects the "chain start" by walking backward through operator-terminated lines. Check that:

1. There's no blank line breaking the chain
2. Each line ends with a continuation operator (`%>%`, `|>`, `+`, `~`, or `%infix%`)
