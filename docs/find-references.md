# Find References

Raven locates all occurrences of a symbol — definitions and usages alike — across your project, not just the current file.

## How It Works

When you invoke Find References (Shift+F12 / right-click → Find All References), Raven:
1. Identifies the name of the identifier at the cursor.
2. Searches the current file, all other open documents, and every workspace-indexed file for identifier nodes with that same name.
3. Returns every match — both definition sites (assignments, function parameters) and usage sites.

Find References is a **name-based** search: it matches on the identifier text, with no dependency-graph or scope filtering. It is intentionally broad — see [Scope and pooling](#scope-and-pooling).

## Cross-File Scoping

Because the search spans all open and indexed files, a definition in one file and its usages in another are returned together:

```r
# main.R
source("utils.R")
result <- helper_function(42)  # ← reference
```

```r
# utils.R
helper_function <- function(x) { x * 2 }  # ← definition
```

Invoking Find References on `helper_function` in either file returns both locations — whether or not a `source()` path connects them.

## Scope and pooling

Unlike completions and diagnostics, Find References does **not** consult the `source()` dependency graph or position-aware scope. Every identifier in the workspace whose name matches is returned, which means:

- Definitions (left-hand sides of assignments, function parameters) are listed alongside usages.
- Same-named symbols in files that are *not* connected by any `source()` path are pooled together rather than treated as distinct symbols.

If you need a result scoped to one symbol's definition, use [Go-to-Definition](go-to-definition.md), which *is* scope- and dependency-aware.

> Find References returns no results when invoked from an R Markdown / Quarto (`.Rmd` / `.qmd`) document.

## Workspace Symbols (Cmd/Ctrl+T)

For project-wide symbol search by name, use **Cmd/Ctrl+T**. This searches all indexed symbols across the workspace by name, regardless of dependency relationships.

The maximum number of results is configurable via `raven.symbols.workspaceMaxResults` (default: 1000).

## JAGS and Stan

For `.stan`, `.jags`, and `.bugs` files, Find References returns all occurrences of the identifier across every open or indexed file of the same language. As with R, this is a flat name match — there is no dependency graph; results are collected by name across all Stan (or JAGS) files in the workspace.

## Go-to-Definition

Go-to-definition is the reverse of find references — it navigates to a symbol's definition rather than listing its usages. See [Go-to-Definition](go-to-definition.md).
