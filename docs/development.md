## Build from source

Prerequisites:
- Rust toolchain (MSRV: 1.96; the workspace is on the 2024 edition)

Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jbearak/raven.git
cd raven
cargo build --release -p raven
# Binary will be at target/release/raven
```

## Build, test, run

- Debug build: `cargo build -p raven`
- Release build: `cargo build --release -p raven`
- Run (stdio): `RAVEN_PERF=1 cargo run -p raven -- --stdio`
- Unit tests: `cargo test -p raven`
- Integration tests: `cargo test -p raven --features test-support -- --test`
- Bun tests (TypeScript): `bun test` (from repo root; `bunfig.toml` sets root to `./tests/bun`)
- VS Code extension tests: `cd editors/vscode && bun run test`
- Setup (build + install + package): `./scripts/setup.sh`

The VS Code extension tests include a real-layout webview harness for the
data-viewer toolbar's responsive chip-wrap behavior
(`editors/vscode/src/test/toolbar-wrap-layout.test.ts` +
`toolbar-wrap-harness-panel.ts`). The harness mounts the production
toolbar JSX in a webview, pins its width via `postMessage`, and posts the
measured geometry back to the host for assertions. The harness bundle
lives at `editors/vscode/dist-test/toolbar-wrap-harness/` — separate from
the shipped `dist/`, built by `bun run bundle:webview-test` (already
wired into `pretest`), excluded from the VSIX. Set
`RAVEN_SKIP_LAYOUT_TESTS=1` to skip the suite in sandboxes that can't
render a webview.

### Benchmarks

All benchmarks except `startup` require `--features test-support`. Set `RAVEN_BENCH_ALLOC=1` for allocation tracking.

- `cargo bench --bench startup`
- `cargo bench --bench lsp_operations --features test-support`
- `cargo bench --bench cross_file --features test-support`
- `cargo bench --bench libpath_capture --features test-support`
- `cargo bench --bench edit_to_publish --features test-support`

The `Performance` GitHub Actions workflow uses the `startup` benchmark for PR
comparison comments. Criterion's `main` baseline is cached from push-to-`main`
runs only; PR runs restore that cache and save their results as a local `pr`
baseline, but must not write the `target/criterion` cache. Allowing PRs to
save the cache can create branch-scoped entries that contain only `pr`, which
then shadow the default-branch cache and make future PRs report "No `main`
baseline found". The PR comparison guard must use `critcmp --baselines` to
detect saved baseline names; `critcmp --list` formats comparison output and
does not prove that a restored `main` baseline exists.

## Profiling startup

Python scripts under `scripts/` measure LSP startup latency:
- `scripts/profile_startup.py`: spawns the LSP, opens files, measures time to first diagnostic
- `scripts/profile_simple.py`: simpler initialization timing

Typical flow:
- `cargo build --release -p raven`
- `python3 scripts/profile_startup.py`

## Heap profiling

For investigating memory usage, allocation patterns, and leaks, Raven supports two heap profiling approaches.

### Quick RSS profiling with `analysis-stats`

The built-in `analysis-stats` command reports peak RSS after each analysis phase — useful for a quick check without any extra tooling:

```bash
cargo build --release -p raven
./target/release/raven analysis-stats /path/to/workspace
```

This reports timing and peak RSS per phase (parse, metadata, scope, packages). Use `--csv` for machine-readable output or `--only <phase>` to isolate a single phase.


## Releasing

### Version bump and tag

Use the bump script to update versions, commit, tag, and push:

```bash
./scripts/bump-version.sh           # patch bump (default): 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch     # same as above
./scripts/bump-version.sh minor     # 0.1.1 -> 0.2.0
./scripts/bump-version.sh major     # 0.2.0 -> 1.0.0
./scripts/bump-version.sh 2.0.0     # explicit version
```

This updates `Cargo.toml` (workspace version) and `editors/vscode/package.json`, commits the change, creates a git tag, and pushes both.

### CI build

Pushing the tag triggers `release-build.yml`, which:
1. Cross-compiles the `raven` binary for 6 platforms (linux-x64, linux-arm64, macos-arm64, macos-x64, windows-x64, windows-arm64)
2. Packages a platform-specific `.vsix` for each target (the binary is embedded in `bin/`)
3. Generates a Sigstore-backed build-provenance attestation (`actions/attest-build-provenance`) for each `raven-<platform>.zip` and `.vsix`, so a published artifact can be verified with `gh attestation verify <file> --repo jbearak/raven`

### Publishing

After the build succeeds, manually run `release-publish.yml` from GitHub Actions:
1. Enter the tag (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
2. Optionally check "Publish to VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX"

This creates a GitHub Release with all binaries and `.vsix` files. If marketplace publishing is enabled, it uploads each platform `.vsix` to both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX.

**Required secrets** (for marketplace publishing): `VSCE_PAT`, `OVSX_PAT`.

## Cross-file internals (high-level)

Cross-file awareness is implemented under `crates/raven/src/cross_file/`.

Rough pipeline:
1. Extract per-file metadata (directives + AST-detected `source()` + library calls)
2. Update dependency graph edges (forward + backward)
3. Compute per-file artifacts (exported interface, timeline, interface hash)
4. Resolve scope at a position by traversing edges and applying call-site filtering
5. Revalidate dependents on relevant changes (interface hash / edges / working directory changes)

### Module map

Key files under `crates/raven/src/cross_file/`:

- `mod.rs` — Public API (`extract_metadata()`)
- `dependency.rs` — Dependency graph (forward + backward edges)
- `scope.rs` — Scope artifacts, interface hash, scope-at-position resolution
- `path_resolve.rs` — Path resolution (forward vs backward invariant)
- `revalidation.rs` — Real-time updates, diagnostics gating, debounce
- `source_detect.rs` — AST-based detection of `source()`, `sys.source()`, and related calls
- `directive.rs` — Parsing of `# raven:` / `@lsp-` directive comments
- `types.rs` — Shared types (`CrossFileMetadata`, `SymbolKind`, etc.)
- `config.rs` — Cross-file configuration (cache sizes, debounce intervals, feature flags)
- `parent_resolve.rs` — Parent-prefix scope resolution (backward-edge traversal)
- `content_provider.rs` — Cross-file content provider (open-doc-authoritative reads)
- `cache.rs` — `MetadataCache`
- `file_cache.rs` — `CrossFileFileCache` (content + existence)
- `workspace_index.rs` — `CrossFileWorkspaceIndex`
- `property_tests.rs` / `integration_tests.rs` — Property-based and integration test suites

### Path resolution invariant (forward vs backward)

There is a deliberate distinction in how relative paths are resolved:
- **Backward directives** (`# raven: sourced-by`, `# raven: run-by`, `# raven: included-by`) are resolved **relative to the child file’s directory**, ignoring `# raven: cd`.
- **Forward directives** (`# raven: source`, `# raven: run`, `# raven: include`) and AST-detected **`source()` calls** resolve using `# raven: cd` when present (otherwise file-relative).

Implementation:
- Backward directives must use `PathContext::new()`.
- Forward directives and `source()` calls must use `PathContext::from_metadata()`.

User-facing explanation/examples live in `docs/cross-file.md`.

### Workspace-root fallback for unannotated codebases

For codebases without `# raven: cd`, `source()` paths are often written relative to the workspace root.

For **AST-detected `source()` calls and forward directives** (`# raven: source`, `# raven: run`, `# raven: include`), Raven attempts:
1. File-relative resolution
2. If the file does not exist *and* there is no explicit/inherited working directory: try workspace-root-relative resolution

Forward directives are semantically equivalent to `source()` calls (see `.kiro/specs/lsp-source-directive/`) and must resolve identically across dependency edges, scope, diagnostics, cmd-click, and path completion. This fallback must **not** apply to backward directives.

### Parent-prefix scope and forward-source traversal

Scope resolution has two distinct graph traversals:
- **Parent prefix**: when resolving a file, Raven first walks backward edges to model symbols available at the start of that file. Symbols introduced only by this prefix are tracked separately so they can be filtered when a child is re-exported through a forward `source()` edge.
- **Forward sources**: Raven then applies the file's local timeline. When following `source()` calls, real forward-source execution uses a path-local copy of the visited map so one sourced sibling's recursive walk cannot make a later sibling source look already visited. Parent-prefix discovery keeps shared visited pruning to avoid expanding every possible parent/forward path while collecting inherited context.

The cached/streaming parent prefix is seeded with the queried URI at `(u32::MAX, u32::MAX)` so a single cache slot covers all positions in that file within a snapshot, whereas the uncached point resolver (`scope_at_position_with_graph`) seeds the visited map at the real `(line, column)`. For acyclic graphs the two seeds are identical. In a cyclic graph the cached prefix is a deliberate over-approximation: a back-edge can re-enter the queried file at `(MAX, MAX)` and so could "see" symbols defined later in that file, but the same-file leak filter (a symbol whose `source_uri` equals the queried URI is dropped from a parent prefix) plus `entry().or_insert()` merging keep the result sound at the symbol level, so those later symbols never surface. Tightening this would require position-dependent cache keys, which would defeat the cache; it is therefore pinned as intentional — `test_cyclic_cached_overapproximates_vs_uncached_point_query` observes the cached and uncached resolvers agreeing on every field at the boundary query (issue #374).

### Interface hash + selective invalidation

`ScopeArtifacts` includes an `interface_hash` used to avoid cascading revalidation when edits don’t change a file’s “exported interface”.

The hash is deterministic and includes:
- Exported symbols — each hashed through `impl Hash for ScopedSymbol`, which covers that type's full identity field set (`name`, `kind`, `source_uri`, `defined_line`, `defined_column`, `signature`, `is_declared`) and deliberately excludes only `defined_end_column` (positional highlight metadata). `Hash` must mirror `PartialEq` field-for-field: a field present in one but not the other makes the hash blind to that kind of edit. The `signature` inclusion (issue #482) is what makes a formals-only edit (`f <- function(a)` → `f <- function(a, b)`) bust the hash and revalidate dependents; `scoped_symbol_hash_eq_field_parity` pins the two impls' field sets together.
- Loaded packages (from `library()` / `require()` / `loadNamespace()`)
- Declared symbols (from `# raven: var` / `# raven: func` directives)

The backend uses `old_interface_hash` vs `new_interface_hash` to decide whether to revalidate dependents.

### Caching model

Cross-file caches use the `lru` crate and are wrapped with locks for interior mutability.

Concurrency choice:
- Reads use `peek()` (no LRU promotion) under read locks.
- Writes use `push()` under write locks.

Implication: eviction is effectively “LRU by insertion/update time”, not “LRU by access time”, which keeps the read path maximally concurrent.

Default capacities are defined close to each cache:
- `MetadataCache`: `crates/raven/src/cross_file/cache.rs`
- `CrossFileFileCache` (content + existence): `crates/raven/src/cross_file/file_cache.rs`
- `CrossFileWorkspaceIndex`: `crates/raven/src/cross_file/workspace_index.rs`
- `WorkspaceIndex`: `crates/raven/src/workspace_index.rs`

Cache sizes are configurable via VS Code settings and applied during initialization/config change.

### Standalone isolated-scope cache (#483 / WI2b)

`# raven: standalone` callees (see `docs/cross-file.md`) are resolved in isolation: no backward parent-prefix walk (WI2a) and — when resolved as a caller's forward `source()` child — canonical, caller-independent inputs (empty packages, no `data()` provider, the file's own `PathContext`; WI2b "part 2"). That makes a standalone file's depth-≥1 isolated EOF scope a pure function of the file and its own forward `source()` closure plus the traversal config, independent of who sources it, so it is cached **across snapshots** rather than per-query — collapsing the per-caller, ×N-revalidation-fan-out, and per-file-`raven check`-snapshot re-resolutions into one compute plus cheap `Arc` clones.

- Module: `crates/raven/src/cross_file/standalone_cache.rs` (`StandaloneScopeCache`, `StandaloneScopeKey`, `StandaloneCacheCtx`). Owned by `WorldState` behind an `Arc` so the diagnostics snapshot clones the handle out from under the read lock and consults the cache with no `WorldState` guard held; default capacity is in that module.
- Key = `(callee_uri, edge_revision, closure_interface_fingerprint, max_chain_depth, hoist_globals, backward_dep_mode, package_config_generation)`. `edge_revision` pins forward-closure membership and must be read from the **real** graph (a cloned per-snapshot `DependencyGraph` resets its own counter); `closure_interface_fingerprint` is an order-sensitive hash over the per-file `interface_hash` of `{C} ∪ forward_closure(C)`, so any closure member's interface edit misses (body/comment/local edits don't). `package_config_generation` (bumped on package-library re-init) is defense-in-depth.
- Hook + soundness: consulted at one place — the top of `scope_at_position_with_graph_recursive`, gated on standalone + full EOF (`MAX,MAX`) + `current_depth >= 1` (the depth-0 own-root query injects `base_exports` and is excluded) + canonical inputs + acyclic graph + no closure member already in `visited` (a visited member would short-circuit its forward `source()` into a truncated, caller-path-dependent scope). Reuse mirrors `ForwardChildMemo`: store only truncation-free scopes, never under cancellation, and serve a stored `compute_depth` for a `reach_depth <= compute_depth` (keeping the deepest). A cache HIT is byte-identical to the un-memoized resolver; `RAVEN_DISABLE_STANDALONE_CACHE=1` forces every resolution to recompute so `raven check .` cache-on vs cache-off can be diffed (the #483 acceptance gate), and `raven check` logs hit/miss counts at `RUST_LOG=raven::cli=trace`.

### Real-time diagnostics & monotonic publishing

Cross-file revalidation is debounced and cancelable.

A diagnostics gate enforces monotonic publishing:
- never publish diagnostics for an older document version
- allow “force republish” at the same version for dependency-triggered revalidation

See `crates/raven/src/cross_file/revalidation.rs`.

Raven intentionally keeps `tower-lsp` at `.concurrency_level(1)` so text-sync notifications remain ordered. Do not use global LSP concurrency to speed up diagnostics. Dependency-triggered fan-out is localized in `crates/raven/src/backend.rs`: `publish_diagnostics_for_uris_bounded` runs the normal debounced diagnostic pipeline for an already-computed URI set with a small fixed concurrency limit (`DIAGNOSTIC_FANOUT_CONCURRENCY`). Each worker rebuilds its own snapshot and commits through the monotonic gate.

### Interactive request cancellation

Raven keeps `tower-lsp` at `.concurrency_level(1)` to preserve ordered text sync, which means tower-lsp's built-in `$/cancelRequest` notification can be delayed behind the in-flight request it is supposed to cancel. `start_lsp()` wraps the `LspService` in `RequestCancellationService`, which intercepts `$/cancelRequest` synchronously in `Service::call` and records cancellations in a request-id keyed registry before tower-lsp queues the notification.

Interactive handlers that can spend noticeable time in cross-file scope resolution should use a request-scoped `DiagCancelToken` from the registry and poll it through long loops and scope helpers. Qualified-member go-to-definition threads this token through `goto_definition_with_cancel` → `resolve_qualified_member_with_cancel` → `get_cross_file_scope_with_cache`, including per-candidate validation. New interactive multi-position resolvers should follow the same pattern: keep a request-local `ParentPrefixCache`, pass the token into every scope lookup, and check the token between candidate batches while still preserving a single `WorldState` snapshot.

### Semantic tokens

Raven advertises full-document semantic tokens for R documents and currently emits the standard LSP `function` token type for function-definition names and call heads. The token legend order is part of the LSP contract: keep `SemanticTokenType::FUNCTION` at index 0 unless all encoded token-type indexes are updated together.

### On-demand indexing

On-demand indexing pulls in files that are not currently open in the editor so their
symbols are available before diagnostics run. It happens **synchronously** in `did_open`
(gated by `raven.crossFile.onDemandIndexing.enabled`), covering, in order:
- direct sourced files
- the forward source chain (bounded by `maxForwardDepth`)
- backward-directive targets (bounded by `maxBackwardDepth`)

See `index_file_on_demand` / `index_forward_chain` / `index_backward_chain` in
`crates/raven/src/backend.rs`.

### Rmd/Quarto raw-content vs masked-analysis split (#343)

For `.Rmd` / `.qmd` documents, everywhere we store or extract cross-file data we keep two views distinct (mirroring the `Document` type docs in `state.rs`):

- **Raw content** — `DocumentStore::DocumentState.contents`, `IndexEntry.contents`, and the `cross_file_file_cache` entry stay verbatim. `ContentProvider::get_content` returns raw, serving snippets and non-R-language text scans.
- **Masked analysis** — the `tree`, `metadata`, `artifacts`, and `loaded_packages` on those same entries are derived from `chunks::mask_to_r` (chunk bodies only). Byte offsets in the stored `tree` index into the masked text, exposed by `DocumentState::analysis_text()`; pairing the tree with raw content mis-slices.

The single chokepoint helpers live in `cross_file/mod.rs`: `analysis_text_for_path(path, content)` (masks for Rmd, borrows raw otherwise) and `extract_metadata_for_path(path, content)`. Every metadata-extraction site that starts from a path-identified file's raw content (did_open, on-demand indexing, file-cache fallbacks in `state.rs`, the legacy-document arms in `content_provider.rs`) routes through these so `.Rmd` files contribute outgoing edges from chunks, never spurious prose-derived ones. `.Rmd`/`.qmd` are intentionally excluded from the proactive workspace scan (outgoing-only); incoming relationships come from an open Rmd or a `.R` file's `# raven: sourced-by` backward directive.

## Package library internals

Raven prefers static parsing for package exports and uses R subprocesses selectively.

Key ideas:
- Parse `NAMESPACE` exports when available (fast)
- Detect `exportPattern()` and only then fall back to an R subprocess for accurate expansion
- If R is unavailable, fall back to `INDEX` parsing (best-effort)
- When merging `Depends` with meta-package `attached_packages`, keep a companion `HashSet` for dedupe; repeated `Vec::contains()` checks make recursive export expansion quadratic.

`PackageLibrary` owns two in-memory side caches: `packages` for direct per-package metadata and `combined_entries` for aggregate availability/ownership snapshots. Both are atomic read-copy snapshots (`arc_swap::ArcSwap<HashMap<...>>`) with a small writer mutex per map to serialize copy-on-write publication. Synchronous cache readers load an immutable snapshot and do normal `HashMap` lookups, so an in-progress writer publication is never semantic absence and cannot produce transient diagnostics. Writers clone the current map, mutate the clone, and publish a new `Arc<HashMap<...>>`; keep those publication sections small and never hold a writer mutex across `.await`, R subprocess calls, disk/provider reads, or recursive package expansion. Multi-map operations such as invalidation publish the two maps sequentially rather than nesting writer gates. Completion readers should clone only the relevant `Arc<PackageInfo>` / `Arc<CombinedEntry>` handles from snapshots before doing string iteration/dedupe.

### Availability vs. ownership: unified aggregate entries (#407)

`combined_entries[pkg]` is the aggregate cache built by `get_all_exports` / `collect_exports_recursive`. Each `CombinedEntry` stores two projections from the same traversal:
- `exports`: *availability* — "is this symbol visible through `pkg`?" This flat aggregate suppresses undefined-variable diagnostics.
- `owners`: *ownership* — "which package owns the help topic / NSE policy?" For `library(tidyverse)`, `exports` contains `mutate` under the `tidyverse` key while `owners` records `mutate -> dplyr`.

The entry is published and invalidated as one immutable snapshot so a reader cannot observe aggregate availability without matching ownership. As recursion visits each contributor it records `owners.entry(symbol).or_insert(contributing_pkg)`. **First contributor wins**, and because the aggregate root is visited before its `depends`/`attached` members, the root owns its own exports while a member owns only symbols the root does not export itself. A symbol the root genuinely re-exports in its own namespace is attributed to the root — an accepted limitation, since names alone cannot tell a re-export from an original export.

Lookups:
- `find_package_owner_for_symbol(symbol, loaded_packages)` consults the unified entry through the snapshot cache contract above. If a present aggregate entry says the symbol is available but lacks ownership, it fails closed instead of falling back to aggregate attribution. If no aggregate entry is warmed, it falls back only to direct per-package exports. Used by hover, the help panel, signature help, the parameter resolver, and the NSE callee resolver (`table_verb_policy` step 3.5, consulted by `resolve_call_arg_policy` before its standard-eval fallback and by the issue #433 dots-forwarding inference in `NseAnalysis::build`).
- `get_owned_exports_for_completions(loaded_packages)` mirrors `get_exports_for_completions` but attributes each symbol to its owner for completion detail / resolve `data.package`.
- `is_symbol_from_loaded_packages` reads `exports` only — availability stays a pure yes/no check.

All R subprocess calls must:
- validate user-controlled inputs (package names, paths)
- use timeouts to avoid hangs
- route through `RSubprocess::execute_r_code{,_with_timeout}` rather than spawning `R` directly

Each `R` spawn is CPU-heavy — loading the base packages alone is 6–11s and pins a core. A global semaphore (`r_subprocess_semaphore` in `r_subprocess.rs`, sized to the available parallelism clamped to the range 2–8) caps how many R processes run at once, so a burst of callers (a 16-way test run, or many documents warming packages at once) cannot oversubscribe every core and starve the latency-sensitive 5s `formals()` queries past their timeout. The permit is taken outside the per-call timeout, so queue-wait never counts against a query's budget. If you see R-gated tests time out only under heavy machine load, suspect spawn volume, not the timeout value.

See `crates/raven/src/package_library.rs` and `crates/raven/src/r_subprocess.rs`.

## Package-export databases (CI / R-free resolution)

This subsystem lets Raven resolve package **export names** without an installed
package or a running R — the case that makes `raven check` usable in CI. It is an
**ordered fallback over three tiers**: Tier 1 (installed, authoritative — the
existing path above) → Tier 2 (a committed, repo-specific `.raven/packages.json`)
→ Tier 3 (a `names.db` sidecar). `names.db` is not bundled with the binary; installs download it with `raven packages update` for broad CRAN/Bioconductor coverage. R's base-priority packages are embedded in the binary (all 14; only the default-attached base-7 are always in scope). The user-facing contract lives in
[`docs/package-database.md`](package-database.md); this section is the internals.

**Critical invariant — names ≠ install status.** The databases feed *export
resolution* only (they suppress the undefined-variable storm when R is absent).
They **never** make a package count as installed. The missing-package diagnostic
is Tier-1-only and is suppressed by default in `raven check` (re-enabled with
`--report-uninstalled`). `package_exists()` is never wired to consult providers.
See `docs/diagnostics.md` and `crates/raven/src/handlers.rs`.

### The `package_db` module

A new top-level module (`crates/raven/src/package_db/`) — declared in
`crates/raven/src/lib.rs` only, while `main.rs` remains a thin shim — owns all
encoding/decoding. `package_library.rs` is not moved or rewritten; it only gains
the seam.

- **One serializable record:** `model::PackageRecord` is the on-disk projection
  of `PackageInfo` — `{ name, version, exports, depends, lazy_data }`, with all
  vectors kept **sorted and de-duplicated** so the Tier 2 JSON is deterministic
  and diff-friendly. `version` (the `DESCRIPTION` `Version`, `""` when unknown)
  rides in both encodings and drives the Tier 3 monotonic merge (see below);
  `PackageInfo` itself carries no version, so `from_info` defaults it to `""` and
  `into_info` drops it — the field is populated only by the capture paths
  (reference-R seed, `freeze`, r-universe ingest). `is_meta_package` /
  `attached_packages` are a pure function of the package name, so they are
  **re-derived on read** (via `PackageInfo::with_details`), never stored.
- **Two encodings, one reader each:**
  - **Tier 2 — `json_db.rs`** (`RepoDb`): deterministic, sorted, pretty JSON,
    committed as `.raven/packages.json`. Carries minimal provenance (Raven
    version, R version, generation epoch) and a `schema_version`
    (`REPO_DB_SCHEMA_VERSION`).
  - **Tier 3 — `binary_db.rs`** (`ShippedDb`): a compact, memory-mapped,
    lazily-decoded container. Layout: `MAGIC(8) | version(u32) | header_len(u32)
    | header(postcard) | payload`. The header (provenance + a `blake3` hex of the
    payload region + an index of `{name, offset, len}`) is decoded **once at
    open**; per-package `PackageRecord`s in the mmap'd payload are postcard-decoded
    **lazily** on lookup. Versioned by `FORMAT_VERSION`. Dependencies: `memmap2`,
    `postcard` (added in Milestone 1); `blake3` was already a dep.
- **Typed reader errors, explained not dropped (decision #9):** each reader
  returns `Absent` (normal, silent) vs `UnsupportedSchema { found, supported }` /
  `UnsupportedFormat` vs `Corrupt`. A present-but-unusable file (e.g. a
  `.raven/packages.json` written by a newer Raven) is **explained and the surface
  continues**: `raven check` prints a specific stderr note, the language server
  raises `window/showMessage`, then resolution degrades to the next tier. A
  missing or unreadable database never hard-fails the LSP or the build.
- **Tier 3 locator order:** environment overrides still win, then the user-data
  sidecar installed by `raven packages update`, then an exe-relative sidecar
  (e.g. one placed next to the binary by hand). Installs normally have only the
  user-data candidate, since `names.db` is not bundled with the binary.

### The `PackageMetadataProvider` seam

Tier 1 stays a bespoke first step inside `get_package` — its subprocess/INDEX
logic is intertwined with `lib_paths` and the caches, and wrapping it would risk
regressing the authoritative path. The new tiers are pure pre-built reads, so the
seam is a small **synchronous** trait:

```rust
pub trait PackageMetadataProvider: Send + Sync {
    fn lookup(&self, name: &str) -> Option<PackageInfo>;
}
```

`PackageLibrary` gains an ordered `providers: Vec<Box<dyn PackageMetadataProvider>>`
(Tier 2 repo DB at index 0, Tier 3 shipped DB next), empty by default. The **one**
hook is in `get_package`: when `find_package_directory` misses (Tier 1 has no
directory), it consults the providers in order; the first hit is cached like any
other `PackageInfo`. A package no provider knows is left **uncached**, so
`package_exists()` still reports it missing.

`prefetch_packages` is **unchanged** (decision #12): its Step 3 already funnels
every loaded package — and transitive `Depends` and meta-package
`attached_packages` — through `get_all_exports → collect_exports_recursive →
get_package`, which carries the hook. So `library(tidyverse)` and `Depends`
chains resolve in CI for free.

**Construction split (decision #6):** `freeze` (and the Tier 3 reference-R seed)
must capture a *provider-less* library so a "frozen Tier 1" file can't be
contaminated by Tier 2/3 guesses. Construction is split into
`build_library_inner` (no providers) feeding both
`build_package_library_tier1_only` (capture) and `build_package_library`
(runtime: inner + provider wiring). Existing 4-arg callers of
`build_package_library` are unchanged.

### Performance discipline (§12)

The LSP hot path (diagnostic collection) reads the in-memory package caches from
already-published snapshots and must not take a disk/page-fault stall. So:

- the Tier 3 index is **preloaded at open**; per-package payloads decode lazily
  from the mmap on first lookup;
- optionally, a one-shot `madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)` over the header/index region
  (~500 KB) right after `mmap` faults the offset table in before the first
  lookup — one syscall, eliminating even the first index page fault. A cheap
  nicety, not required for correctness, and a no-op on platforms without
  `madvise`;
- the `blake3` payload checksum is verified **at open, in `spawn_blocking`**
  (decision #13) — ~10–20 ms once during library init, off the async runtime —
  catching truncation/corruption/tampering;
- provider results feed the existing per-package cache, so steady-state lookups
  stay in-memory and make no provider call.

### Tier 3 build pipeline

The shipped `names.db` is built **append-only** from an authoritative reference-R
capture of the build machine's **entire installed library**
(`enumerate_installed_packages` across all lib paths, via the Tier 1 path:
`NAMESPACE` + subprocess `exportPattern` expansion + `data/` datasets) **∪** CRAN
+ Bioc r-universe (`cran.r-universe.dev` and `bioc.r-universe.dev` per-package
`_exports`/`_dependencies`/`_datasets`). Each rebuild **seeds from the previous
database by default** (append-only; `--fresh` rebuilds from scratch) and **never
drops** a package. **The merge is version-driven and monotonic (decision #16):**
for each package it keeps the record with the **highest version across all three
sources** (prior DB, reference-R, r-universe), so a package is never moved to an
older export set — a newer CRAN/Bioc release beats an older reference-R install, a
newer local/dev build beats an older CRAN release, and a still-newer prior capture
is retained. Equal versions tiebreak reference-R → r-universe → prior. The
comparison reads a `version` field on `PackageRecord` (captured from `DESCRIPTION`
`Version` by the reference-R seed and `freeze`, or the r-universe JSON `Version`);
the field rides in both encodings, so Tier 2 `.raven/packages.json` shows version
changes in `git diff` too. The full
installed library is the point — hard-to-install / GitHub-only / internal
packages enter the floor only this way, and append-only keeps them. The
maintainer **bootstraps** the floor once from a richly-provisioned machine; teams
can build a private `names.db` from their own library for richer in-house
coverage.

- **Entry point:** `raven packages build-shipped-db` (maintainer/CI-only — the
  shipped binary itself is **network-free**; `scripts/build-names-db.sh` uses
  `curl` to download the r-universe metadata that the command then transforms).
  **Fetch is one bulk `/api/dbdump` per universe — 2 requests, not ~24k
  per-package (issue #371).** The per-package crawl ran 1h+ and needed a 5% skip
  tolerance; the BSON dump is the full-coverage single artifact (crates.io
  `db-dump` analogue) and runs in seconds. `cran.r-universe.dev`'s
  array/stream `/api/packages` endpoint is **not** usable — on that meta-universe
  it silently returns only the ~13% directly-hosted subset, so the dump is the
  only complete bulk source. `--runiverse-cran`/`--runiverse-bioc` accept either
  a `.bson` dump file (parsed by `parse_runiverse_dbdump`) or a directory of
  per-package JSON (the legacy fixture layout); `ingest_runiverse_path`
  dispatches on file-vs-dir. The script's `/api/ls`-count sanity gate aborts on a
  truncated dump. Code: `cli/packages.rs`, `package_db/{merge,runiverse}.rs`.
- **Embedded base packages (ADR 1):** all 14 of R's base-priority packages
  (`installed.packages(priority="base")`) are compiled into the binary as a
  `// @generated` per-package table in
  `embedded_base.rs` / `embedded_base_generated.rs`. Regenerate with
  `raven packages build-embedded-base --reference-lib <DIR>`. `initialize()`
  loads every package into the per-package cache (datasets → `lazy_data`) so
  `library(grid)` etc. resolve offline, but only the 7 default-attached packages
  (`get_fallback_base_packages()`: `base`, `methods`, `utils`, `grDevices`,
  `graphics`, `stats`, `datasets`) seed the flat always-in-scope `base_exports`
  set + `base_packages`. `names.db` excludes all base-priority packages
  post-merge (the `build-shipped-db` filter strips everything embedded, via
  `embedded_base_packages()`). A real R install
  still wins.
- **Delivery (decision #14):** one sidecar — `names.db` + checksums — lives on a
  **GitHub Release** (moving `names-db` tag) — durable across runs, unlike a
  per-run CI artifact. `raven packages update` is the explicit network boundary for
  source/Cargo installs and should be part of CI image setup/cache warmup, not
  normal LSP startup, completion, hover, package lookup, or `raven check`. A
  `workflow_dispatch` + scheduled job
  (`.github/workflows/build-names-db.yml`; weekly schedule `0 6 * * 1`) downloads
  the current asset (the seed), rebuilds via the shared
  `scripts/build-names-db.sh`, and re-uploads. `release-build.yml` does not
  bundle `names.db`: release archives ship only the `raven` binary, and the VSIX
  omits it too (VS Code users resolve their locally installed packages via Tier 1).
  A Git LFS seed is committed at
  `crates/raven/data/names-db-seed.db` for bootstrap/disaster-recovery only (not a
  build input). Located via the Tier 3 candidate locator — `RAVEN_NAMES_DB`
  override, then user data, then exe-relative. **Not** `include_bytes!` (avoids
  binary bloat), **not** committed to git (except tiny back-compat fixtures).
- The scheduled `build-names-db.yml` workflow stays on the default branch so GitHub Actions can run its cron, but its `actions/checkout` step is pinned to the protected `names-db-builder` branch. That branch is the production source line for the DB builder; merge only reviewed, release-compatible DB-builder changes into it.
- `release-build.yml` does **not** bundle `names.db`; release archives contain only the `raven` binary (plus `LICENSE`), and users obtain the sidecar with `raven packages update`. Before fanning out the platform builds, a `names-db-compat` job runs `raven packages validate-shipped-db` against the current `names-db` Release asset — a compatibility gate confirming the Raven being released can open and validate the database users will download — without bundling it.
- **Replacing the file (Windows mmap lock):** while `names.db` is mapped, Windows
  holds the file open (`CreateFileMapping` keeps a handle), so it cannot be
  overwritten in place. Writers (the bundle step, and any future in-process
  refresh) must use **atomic rename** — write `names.db.tmp`, then rename over the
  old file. On POSIX the rename succeeds even with the old inode still mapped
  (readers keep the old mapping until they re-open); on Windows an in-process
  refresh must **unmap → replace → remap**, tolerating a brief window with no
  mapping. This is a solved pattern (SQLite, clangd) but is called out so the
  implementation doesn't assume in-place overwrite works everywhere.
- **Growth bound:** append-only means the file grows monotonically, but slowly —
  at CRAN's ~2k-packages/year rate, ~1.7 MB/year, so a ~20–25 MB database stays
  under ~40 MB a decade out. Names-only storage keeps the bound comfortable; no
  pruning is planned.

### Dependency on #350 (package-dataset resolution)

`PackageRecord` captures `lazy_data`. [raven#350](https://github.com/jbearak/raven/issues/350)
(landed) wired dataset resolution into `collect_exports_recursive`, so a Tier 2/3
record's `lazy_data` is folded into the resolvable set automatically — *non-base*
package datasets resolve in CI with no extra work in this subsystem. (Base
datasets come via the embedded base table, above.)

### Testing approach

- **Runtime tempdir fixtures** for round-trip tests (write → open → lookup) of
  both encodings, plus bad-magic / version-skew / payload-tamper rejection.
- **Committed back-compat fixtures** (decision #15): tiny `names.db` +
  `.raven/packages.json` under `crates/raven/tests/fixtures/package_db/` guard
  format back-compat ("old fixtures still load").
- **No-R consumer integration test** (`tests/package_db_consumer.rs`): empty
  libpaths, `library(dplyr); mutate(...)` yields no undefined-variable;
  `library(dpylr)` behaves per the names-vs-install-status split.
- **Build-side differential** (deferred to the `build-names-db` job, where R + a
  sample corpus are available): diff `names.db` against `getNamespaceExports()`.
- **Generation round-trip** (on a machine with R): generate `.raven/packages.json`,
  read it back, assert parity with the live Tier 1 result.

## Other subsystems

Brief orientation for modules outside the cross-file and package-library subsystems.

- **`package_state/`** — Derived state for R package mode. Owns workspace detection result, namespace model, per-file facts (exported symbols, roxygen tags), and the aggregate scope contribution. Fully derive-based: `derive_package_state()` recomputes the entire `PackageState` from inputs.
- **`package_namespace.rs`** — R package workspace detection (DESCRIPTION-based) and namespace model. Detects roxygen-managed packages by scanning for `#' @export` in `R/*.R` files.
- **`help/`** — R help text and HTML rendering. `text` submodule provides Rd2txt for hover/completion; `html` submodule shells out to R's `tools::Rd2HTML` for the webview help panel. Results are cached via `HtmlHelpCache`.
- **`libpath_watcher.rs`** — Filesystem watcher for `.libPaths()` directories using the `notify` crate. Watches recursively, debounces events, diffs directory snapshots, and emits `LibpathEvent::Changed` with added/removed/touched package deltas.
- **`qualified_resolve.rs`** — Resolves the RHS of `$` and `@` operators for go-to-definition. Collects member-assignment candidates from the defining file and cross-file scope contributors, validates via re-resolution, and tie-breaks by dependency-graph distance.
- **`parameter_resolver.rs`** — Resolves function parameter info for completion suggestions. Extracts parameters from AST for user-defined functions; queries R subprocess `formals()` for package functions. Uses an LRU cache for subprocess results.
- **`roxygen.rs`** — Parses roxygen2 (`#'`) and plain comment blocks above function definitions. Extracts title, description, and `@param` entries for hover and completion documentation.
- **`content_provider.rs`** — Unified file access abstraction. Respects the "open docs are authoritative" rule: open documents are read from the document store; closed files fall through to disk/cache.
- **`editors/vscode/src/knit/knit-output-panel.ts`** — Per-source-path webview-panel registry for the `Raven: Knit` output viewer. Keyed by `sourceUri.fsPath` (aligned with the in-flight gate in `knit-commands.ts`). Tracks a `previewColumn` static so new panels stack as tabs in a single column rather than scattering; `recomputePreviewColumn` runs on every `onDidChangeViewState` / `onDidDispose` and adopts a surviving panel's column when the recorded one empties. The companion `help/help-panel.ts` remains a singleton (one R-help context per session is the right shape for that domain). See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-knit-panel-per-file-design.md`.
- **`editors/vscode/src/viewer-tab-icon.ts`** + **`version-gate.ts`** — Editor-tab icons for the four webview viewers, assigned via `WebviewPanel.iconPath`. Codicon ids: help → `question`, data → `table`, plot → `graph`, knit → `book`. `WebviewPanel.iconPath` only honors a `ThemeIcon` at runtime on VSCode ≥ 1.110 (microsoft/vscode#282608); Raven's engine and `@types/vscode` floors both stay at `^1.82.0`, so `viewerTabIcon` returns `undefined` on older hosts (leaving the default page icon) and `applyViewerTabIcon` is the single helper callers should use. `applyViewerTabIcon` centralizes the locally widened `WebviewPanel.iconPath` cast required because the 1.82 typings only accept image `Uri` icons even though VSCode ≥ 1.110 accepts a `ThemeIcon` at runtime. `version-gate.ts` stays free of any `vscode` import so the pure `meetsMinVersion` is bun-testable (`tests/bun/version-gate.test.ts`).

### `package_state/sysdata.rs` — sysdata symbol extraction

`crates/raven/src/package_state/sysdata.rs` extracts the symbols written to `R/sysdata.rda` (package-internal data) and the names bound by `.onLoad`/`.onAttach`. The strategy is AST-first:

1. **AST scan** — walks `data-raw/**/*.R` (recursively) looking for `usethis::use_data(..., internal = TRUE)` (also the `devtools::use_data` re-export and bare `use_data`) and `save(..., file = "...sysdata.rda")` calls. Also scans `R/*.R` files for `.onLoad`/`.onAttach` definitions and collects `assign("x", ..., envir = <ns>)` and `<ns>$x <- ...` bindings where the receiver is provably namespace-like (`topenv(environment())`, `asNamespace(...)`, `getNamespace(...)`, `parent.env(environment())`).

2. **R-subprocess fallback** — only when the AST scan finds nothing *and* `R/sysdata.rda` actually exists (e.g. sources that commit the binary `.rda` with no `data-raw/` generating script, like r-lib/cli). Loads the file via a one-shot R subprocess (`load()` into an empty env, then `ls()`), subject to a 10-second `tokio::time::timeout`. Results are cached by file digest so the subprocess is called at most once per `.rda` version. Any failure is fail-soft (returns empty). The trigger predicate is single-sourced in `backend::sysdata_r_fallback_needed` and the fallback runs in **both** the LSP startup path (`backend.rs`) and `raven check` (`cli/check.rs::maybe_load_sysdata_fallback`), so editor and CLI agree that a package's own `R/` code can reference its sysdata objects. The names feed only package-mode scope — a user script doing `library(cli); emojis` still flags.

### `system.file()` source resolution

`system.file(package = "pkg", "path/to/file.R")` calls are used by packages to reference installed data files. Raven resolves these to concrete paths and adds them as forward-source edges so cross-file analysis works across package boundaries.

**Lifecycle:** Resolution is deferred until `lib_paths` are ready — the workspace scan may run before the package library is initialized. `resolve_system_file_in_workspace()` in `state.rs` is called at the end of the workspace scan, after `PackageLibrary` initialization completes, on every `LibpathEvent::Changed` (package install/removal under a watched libpath), and after a DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE manifest change (`backend.rs`). All calls are idempotent.

**Retention:** `resolve_system_file_sources()` never clears `ForwardSource.system_file` and never drops unresolved entries — resolution state (`path`, `resolved_uri`) is recomputed from scratch on every pass. This is what makes the lifecycle events above recoverable without re-extracting metadata: an edge to a not-yet-installed package forms once the package appears, a stale edge to a removed package is cleared, and a workspace `Package:` rename re-targets self-package (branch 1) references. An unresolved entry is inert (empty `path`, no `resolved_uri`): the dependency graph and scope resolution produce no edge for it and the missing-file collectors skip it (`ForwardSource::exempt_from_missing_file_diagnostics` is the single predicate). `resolve_system_file_in_workspace()` covers both metadata stores — the workspace index (closed files) and the document store (open buffers, whose metadata is authoritative and read in preference to the index) — and returns the URIs whose resolution actually changed; `system_file_republish_set()` expands them with open transitive dependents (a parent's scope traverses child edges, so a child's new edge changes the parent's diagnostics). The libpath-event consumer uses the package-filtered variant (`resolve_system_file_in_workspace_for_packages`) behind a cheap `any_entry` pre-check, so workspaces without matching system.file sources never take the write lock and unrelated resolved entries are never re-probed (see `crates/raven/tests/system_file_source.rs` `lifecycle` tests).

**Locking discipline:** Callers must not hold the `WorldState` read lock across resolution. `WorldState::snapshot_system_file_inputs()` captures workspace name, workspace root, and `lib_paths` under the lock; the caller then drops the guard before calling `cross_file::resolve_system_file_sources()`. See `crates/raven/src/state.rs` and `backend.rs` for the two call sites.

**Re-resolution:** If a `system.file()` source edge resolves to a path that was previously reported as an error (`unresolved-source-path`), the diagnostic is retracted once resolution succeeds.

### Package-corpus workflow

`crates/raven/tests/package_corpus.rs` is a long-running `raven check` regression suite against real R package sources. It is `#[ignore]`d by default because it requires network access to fetch package tarballs.

**Two TOML ledgers** — committed at `crates/raven/tests/fixtures/package_corpus/`:
- `accepted_real_diagnostics.toml` — diagnostics that are real bugs in the package (true positives, accepted as known findings).
- `known_false_positives.toml` — diagnostics Raven emits incorrectly (tracked false positives, expected to shrink over time).

**Running the corpus:** Use `--ignored --nocapture` to activate:
```bash
cargo test -p raven --test package_corpus -- --ignored --nocapture
```

**Env-var filters** (combine freely):
- `RAVEN_CORPUS_GROUPS=base,recommended` — run only packages in the named group(s).
- `RAVEN_CORPUS_PACKAGES=dplyr,DT` — run only the named packages.
- `RAVEN_CORPUS_ALLOW_UNCLASSIFIED=1` — pass when a new diagnostic appears that hasn't been triaged yet; without it, unclassified findings fail the run.
- `RAVEN_CORPUS_KEEP_TEMP=1` — preserve fetched package sources for local inspection.

## Coding conventions (repo-level)

- Avoid `bail!`; prefer explicit `return Err(anyhow!(...))`.
- Prefer `log::trace!` in hot/verbose paths.
- Avoid blocking filesystem I/O on request handlers; use async or `spawn_blocking`.
- Be careful with UTF-16 vs byte offsets: convert before constructing tree-sitter `Point`s.

## Testing notes

- Unit tests live alongside modules under `#[cfg(test)]`.
- Property-based tests use `proptest`.
- Integration tests live in `crates/raven/tests/` (performance budgets, libpath watching, indentation). These require `--features test-support`.
- Bun tests (`tests/bun/`) cover TypeScript extension logic: plot viewer, data viewer, help viewer, send-to-R, config validation.
- VS Code extension tests (`editors/vscode/src/test/`) use `@vscode/test-cli` with Mocha.

### AST inspection utility

For quickly validating tree-sitter node kinds, use the `inspect_ast()` helper (see `crates/raven/src/handlers.rs`). Run with `--nocapture` to print.
