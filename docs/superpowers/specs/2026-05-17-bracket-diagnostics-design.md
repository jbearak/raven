# Bracket / brace / paren diagnostics: helpful messages and anchor on opener

**Status:** Approved (design); ready for implementation plan
**Date:** 2026-05-17
**Scope:** `crates/raven/src/handlers.rs` (syntax-error pipeline) and `docs/diagnostics.md`.

## Problem

Two related shortcomings in how Raven reports unbalanced delimiters:

1. **Stray closer** (a `}`, `)`, `]`, or `]]` that has no matching opener in the file)
   emits the generic message `Syntax error` instead of telling the user what's
   actually wrong. The audited table in `docs/diagnostics.md` does not list any
   targeted message for this case.

2. **Unclosed opener** (a `{`, `(`, `[`, or `[[` with no matching closer) emits
   the diagnostic squiggle at the *end of the offending statement* — the spot
   where tree-sitter inserted its `MISSING` node, walked back to the last code
   line by `anchor_missing_position`. The squiggle never lands on the opening
   delimiter itself, so the user's eye is directed at "where parsing ran out"
   rather than at the broken expression's actual start.

Both shortcomings show up in well-formed R that's missing exactly one
character. They're the kind of mistake users make often when typing.

## Approved decisions

| Decision | Value |
|---|---|
| Anchor for unclosed opener | On the opening `{`/`(`/`[`/`[[` character, spanning to the end of meaningful content on that line (trailing comments and trailing whitespace excluded). |
| Message for unclosed opener | `` Unclosed `(`: missing matching `)` `` (and `{`/`[`/`[[` variants) |
| Anchor for stray closer | On the closer token's own UTF-16 `start..end` |
| Message for stray closer | `` Missing opening `{` `` (and `(`/`[`/`[[` variants) |
| Multi-fault behavior | Each *distinct* delimiter problem emits its own diagnostic — but a stray closer that lives inside an unclosed opener's arguments (e.g. `f(}`) coalesces into a single `Mismatched brackets` diagnostic, because the user almost certainly typed the wrong closer character. |
| Closer runs (`}}}`, `)))`, etc.) | One diagnostic covering the whole run — tree-sitter does not tokenize the characters individually, and splitting them ourselves would add noise without informational value. |
| Mismatched-bracket case | Existing `Mismatched brackets: …` message keeps priority; its scope is extended to also fire when the opener lives in a structural parent of the stray closer's ERROR (see `f(}` case). |
| Unclosed string literal | Unchanged (separate issue) |

## Empirically verified tree-sitter-r parse shapes

The design depends on what tree-sitter-r actually produces. These shapes were
verified by probe against the pinned grammar
(`95aff097aa927a66bb357f715b58cde821be8867` per `crates/raven/Cargo.toml`):

- **`x <- 1\n}\n`** → `program(binary_operator, ERROR(ERROR "}"))` — stray `}`
  is a single ERROR leaf at top level.
- **`}}}\n`** → `program(ERROR(ERROR "}}}"))` — runs of closers are a single
  undifferentiated ERROR span. Tree-sitter does NOT split them into per-`}`
  tokens.
- **`x <- 1\n]]\n`** → `program(binary_operator, ERROR(ERROR "]]"))` — `]]` is
  a single token even when stray.
- **`f(g(h(\n`** → `program(identifier "f", ERROR("(" "g" "(" "h" "("))` — when
  multiple openers are unclosed at the same nesting depth, tree-sitter
  produces a FLAT ERROR containing each opener token as a direct child. There
  are NO `MISSING` nodes in this shape. Any design that finds the opener only
  by walking up from a `MISSING` will miss every level.
- **`f <- function() { x <- 1\n y <- 2\n`** → `function_definition(...,
  braced_expression("{" ... } [MISSING] ""))` — the unclosed `{` lives as the
  first child of `braced_expression`; the `MISSING }` is the last child of
  the same node. Single-level parent walk from `MISSING` finds the opener.
- **`x <- mean(c(1, 2, 3)\n`** → `binary_operator(call(identifier,
  arguments("(" ... ")" comment ")" [MISSING])))` — the unclosed `(` of
  `mean(` lives in `arguments` (parent of the `MISSING )`), not in `call`.
  The opener is `arguments`'s first child.
- **`vec[1, 2\n`** → `subset(identifier "vec", arguments("[" ... "]"
  [MISSING]))` — same pattern as call. The `arguments` node is the direct
  parent of `MISSING`, opener `[` is its first child.
- **`vec[[1, 2\n`** → `subset2(identifier "vec", arguments("[[" ... "]]"
  [MISSING]))` — same pattern; opener `[[` (width 2 token), `MISSING ]]`.
- **`library(`** → `program(call(identifier, arguments("(" ")" [MISSING])))`
  — top-level unclosed call. `MISSING )` has parent `arguments`, opener `(`
  is its first child.
- **`f() }\n`** → `program(call(...), ERROR(ERROR "}"))` — complete call,
  then a sibling ERROR for the stray `}`.
- **`f(} y\n`** → `program(call(identifier "f", arguments("(" ERROR(ERROR
  "}") argument ")" [MISSING])))` — unclosed `(` with a stray `}` and
  trailing identifier inside its argument list. The `}` is an ERROR child of
  `arguments`; the `MISSING )` is at the end of `arguments`. This is the
  case that gets coalesced into a mismatched-bracket diagnostic.
- **`c(1, 2]`** → `program(identifier, ERROR("(" arg "," arg ERROR "]"))` —
  the existing mismatched-bracket detector handles this shape.
- **`f( # comment\n`** → `program(call(identifier, arguments("(" comment ")"
  [MISSING])))` — opener line has nothing of value after the `(` except a
  comment; the spec's "spans to end of meaningful content" rule must trim
  past the comment.

## Architecture

All changes live in `crates/raven/src/handlers.rs`, inside the existing
syntax-error pipeline: `collect_syntax_errors` →
`classify_error` / `minimize_error_range` / `anchor_missing_position`. No
new modules.

Because today's `classify_error` returns a single `String` and the existing
contract emits exactly one diagnostic per `ERROR`, supporting "multiple
diagnostics per ERROR" requires a structural refactor of that boundary
without breaking the existing classifiers.

### Internal types and helper signatures

```rust
struct ClassifiedSyntaxDiagnostic {
    message: String,
    range: Range,
}

enum ErrorClassification {
    /// One diagnostic describes the whole ERROR (e.g. unclosed string,
    /// mismatched bracket). Stop iterating.
    Whole(ClassifiedSyntaxDiagnostic),
    /// Multiple diagnostics extracted from the ERROR's children.
    /// Empty Vec means "no specific classification — caller falls back
    /// to a single generic 'Syntax error' at the minimized range".
    Multi(Vec<ClassifiedSyntaxDiagnostic>),
}

/// Per-traversal mutable state threaded through `collect_syntax_errors`.
/// Lets the classifier coalesce a MISSING follow-up that was already
/// reported via a mismatched-bracket diagnostic on the same opener.
#[derive(Default)]
struct CollectState {
    /// Tree-sitter Node IDs of opener tokens already covered by a
    /// `Mismatched brackets` diagnostic. The MISSING-handling branch
    /// must skip emitting a separate `Unclosed X` for any opener whose
    /// node ID appears here.
    covered_openers: HashSet<usize>,
}

/// Signature of the new opener-anchoring helper. Needs the source text
/// to compute UTF-16 columns and end-of-meaningful-content.
fn find_opener_for_missing(missing: Node, text: &str) -> Option<(Node, Range)>;

/// Compute the UTF-16 column just past the last non-comment, non-
/// whitespace character on `line`. Used by the opener-anchoring helper
/// to trim trailing comments and whitespace from the range.
fn end_of_meaningful_content(line: &str) -> u32;
```

`classify_error` returns `ErrorClassification` instead of `String`, and
takes `&mut CollectState` so it can record openers covered by mismatched-
bracket diagnostics. The single production caller (`collect_syntax_errors`
— verified to be the only one) passes the state through its recursion.
This keeps the single-classifier contract for existing classifiers (they
all return `Whole` and don't touch state) while allowing the new
delimiter logic to return `Multi` and the coalescing rule to suppress
duplicate MISSING follow-ups.

### Classifier ordering inside `classify_error`

The classifier runs each pass in this order, returning the first result
that classifies the ERROR:

1. Unclosed string literal *(existing — `Whole`)*
2. Consecutive pipe *(existing — `Whole`)*
3. Mismatched bracket — **extended** to also detect openers in structural
   parents (the `f(}` case). Returns `Whole` with `Mismatched brackets: …`.
4. Fat-arrow typo *(existing — `Whole`)*
5. **Delimiter scan** *(new — `Multi`)*. Scans the ERROR's direct children
   for opener tokens (unclosed) and closer tokens (stray) and produces one
   diagnostic per finding. See *Delimiter scan rules* below.
6. Fallback: return `Multi(vec![])` → caller emits a single
   `Syntax error` at the minimized range (today's behavior).

### Delimiter scan rules

The delimiter scan converts an ERROR's structure into a flat stream of
delimiter events (`Open(kind, byte_pos)` / `Close(kind, byte_pos, end_byte)`),
then processes the stream with a stack.

**Event extraction.** Walk the ERROR's direct children left-to-right.
For each child:

- **If the child is a recognized opener token** (`text == "(" | "{" | "[" | "[["`):
  emit one `Open` event at the child's start position.
- **If the child is a recognized closer token** (`text == ")" | "}" | "]" | "]]"`):
  emit one `Close` event spanning the child's range.
- **If the child is itself an ERROR or unrecognized leaf whose text
  consists only of closer characters** (`}`, `)`, `]` — any mix or repetition):
  treat the leaf as a sequence of closers and emit events using these rules:
  - A **homogeneous run** of one closer kind (`}}}`, `)))`, `]]`, `]]]]`,
    etc.) → ONE `Close` event spanning the entire run. The closer kind
    is the single character making up the run; for `]]` and `]]]]`-style
    runs, treat consecutive pairs as `]]` tokens left-to-right (so `]]]`
    becomes one `]]` event covering cols 0..2 plus one `]` event at
    col 2..3).
  - A **mixed run** of multiple closer kinds (`])`, `}]`, `)]`, etc.) →
    ONE `Close` event per character (or per `]]` pair), emitted in
    source order at the appropriate byte ranges.
- **If the child is a nested ERROR** whose direct children include
  delimiter tokens, recurse one level into it and apply the same rules
  to its direct children. Do NOT recurse into non-ERROR semantic
  children — they have their own balanced structure that the parser has
  already validated.
- **Any other child** (identifier, literal, comment, complete semantic
  subtree) is skipped — it cannot contribute a delimiter event.

**Stack processing.** Iterate the event stream:

1. `Open` → push `(kind, byte_pos, row, col_utf16, line_text)` onto the stack.
2. `Close` → consult the top of the stack:
   - **Stack empty** → it's a stray closer. Emit
     `` Missing opening `X` `` at the closer event's range
     (UTF-16-converted).
   - **Top matches (same kind)** → pop. The pair lived inside the
     ERROR; nothing to report.
   - **Top is mismatched** → emit
     `` Mismatched brackets: `O` opened here; close with `C` not `W`. ``
     (where `O` is the opener kind, `C` is the expected closer for `O`,
     and `W` is the actual wrong-closer kind). Pop and record the
     opener's node ID in `CollectState::covered_openers` so the
     downstream MISSING handler suppresses any `Unclosed O` diagnostic
     for the same opener. The diagnostic range is the closer event's
     range (UTF-16-converted).
3. **After the stream is exhausted**, walk the remaining openers on
   the stack. For each opener, emit
   `` Unclosed `X`: missing matching `Y` `` ranged from
   `(row, col_utf16)` through the **next unclosed opener on the same
   line, or end-of-meaningful-content on that line, whichever comes
   first**. The "next unclosed opener on the same line" rule prevents
   overlapping ranges when multiple openers share one line (e.g.
   `f(g(h(`: outer `(` spans cols 1–3, middle `(` spans 3–5, inner
   `(` spans 5–6).

This pass produces between zero and N diagnostics where N is the
number of delimiter events in the ERROR. For `f(g(h(`: stack ends with
three unclosed `(` → three diagnostics with non-overlapping ranges. For
`}}}`: one homogeneous-run event → one `` Missing opening `{` ``
diagnostic spanning the run. For `])`: two mixed events → two
diagnostics, one per character.

### Stray closer adjacent to an unclosed opener (coalescing)

The very common `f(}` typo has two parse shapes depending on whether
content follows the wrong closer:

- **Flat-ERROR shape** (`f(}`, `f(}\n`): `program(identifier, ERROR("("
  ERROR(ERROR "}")))`. No `arguments` node; the `(` and the `}` are
  both inside one flat ERROR. The delimiter scan handles this via its
  "Top is mismatched" rule (step 2.c above) — one `Mismatched brackets`
  diagnostic, no Unclosed-X follow-up. No special coalescing rule
  needed.
- **Arguments shape** (`f(} y`, `f(} 1`): `program(call(identifier,
  arguments("(" ERROR(ERROR "}") argument MISSING ")")))`. Here the
  parser was able to extract a trailing argument, so the structure
  partially recovered — the wrong closer sits in an ERROR child of
  `arguments`, and the MISSING `)` is at the end. This case needs an
  explicit coalescing rule (below) because the delimiter scan only
  sees the `}` ERROR (not the opener `(`, which is `arguments`'s first
  child).

**Coalescing rule for the `arguments` shape.** Inside the
mismatched-bracket detector (classifier step 3), when an ERROR has no
opener-token child but has exactly one closer-token leaf descendant,
walk up to the ERROR's direct parent. If the parent kind is
`arguments`, `braced_expression`, or `parenthesized_expression`, AND
the parent's first child is an opener token whose matching closer kind
is *different* from the ERROR's closer leaf, AND the parent's last
child is `MISSING` of the expected closer kind, then:

1. Emit one `Mismatched brackets` diagnostic anchored on the ERROR's
   closer leaf, with message
   `` Mismatched brackets: `O` opened here; close with `C` not `W`. ``
   (opener `O` and expected closer `C` from the parent's opener;
   actual wrong-closer `W` from the ERROR leaf).
2. Record the opener token's node ID in `CollectState::covered_openers`.

The MISSING-anchoring branch checks `covered_openers` before emitting
`Unclosed O: missing matching C` for that opener, and skips it. The set
is mutable state on `CollectState` threaded through `classify_error` and
the MISSING-handling code.

### Opener anchoring via MISSING (single-level parent walk)

For `MISSING` nodes whose kind is a closer (`)`, `}`, `]`, `]]`) and which
are NOT already covered by the coalescing rule above:

1. Get the `MISSING`'s direct parent.
2. Confirm the parent kind is one of `arguments`, `braced_expression`,
   `parenthesized_expression` (verified shapes — see above).
3. Take that parent's first child token as the opener.
4. Anchor range: `(opener_row, opener_col_utf16)` →
   `(opener_row, end_of_meaningful_content_col)` (defined below).
5. If the parent kind is unrecognized (defensive), fall back to today's
   `anchor_missing_position` behavior.

Non-bracket `MISSING` kinds (e.g. the trailing identifier of `x <-`)
continue through the existing direct-`MISSING` branch unchanged.

### End-of-meaningful-content column

The opener-line range stops at the start of any trailing comment, and
trims trailing whitespace. Concretely:

1. Take the line containing the opener.
2. Find the last non-whitespace byte before the first `#` *that is outside
   any string or backtick* on that line.
3. Convert that byte offset to a UTF-16 column via
   `byte_offset_to_utf16_column`.
4. If there is nothing meaningful after the opener (only whitespace or a
   comment), the range collapses to the opener token's own width.

This avoids underlining comments and trailing whitespace in cases like
`f( # comment` (range = just the `(`) and `f(   ` (range = just the `(`).

## Edge cases

**E1. `[[` and `]]` are single tokens.** The delimiter scan and
mismatched-bracket detector both recognise these as one token of width 2.

**E2. Top-level `MISSING` outside any `ERROR`.** `x <-` produces a lone
`MISSING identifier` at the program level. No opener to anchor on. The
direct-`MISSING` branch (handlers.rs:6308 today) is unchanged in message
and anchor for non-bracket `MISSING` kinds. Bracket-kind `MISSING` nodes
at the top level *are* re-routed through the single-level parent walk so
that `library(` still produces a useful diagnostic anchored on the `(`.

**E3. Nested unclosed openers — flat ERROR.** `f(g(h(` parses as a flat
ERROR containing three `(` tokens and two intervening identifiers, with
NO `MISSING` nodes. The delimiter-scan rule handles this: stack ends with
three unclosed `(` → three diagnostics, one anchored on each `(`. The
spec's earlier draft assumed `MISSING` descendants; this case is now
covered by the structural scan instead.

**E4. Mismatched-bracket: extended scope.**
- `c(1, 2]` — opener and wrong closer both inside the same ERROR;
  existing detector handles this and returns `Whole`.
- `f(}` — opener in `arguments`, wrong closer inside an ERROR child of
  `arguments`; new extended detector returns `Whole` (single mismatched-
  brackets diagnostic) and suppresses the `MISSING )` follow-up.
- The stray-closer pass does NOT additionally emit `Missing opening `X``
  in either case.

**E5. Stray closer immediately after a valid expression.** `f() }` — `f()`
parses as a complete `call`, then `}` is its own ERROR sibling. The
delimiter scan on that ERROR finds one stray closer with no preceding
opener → one diagnostic `Missing opening `{`` on the `}`.

**E6. Multiple stray closers in a run.** `}}}` parses as ONE `ERROR`
containing ONE leaf ERROR whose text is `"}}}"`. The delimiter scan treats
this leaf as a single stray closer and emits ONE diagnostic
`Missing opening `{`` spanning the whole leaf. This was a deliberate
design choice (see *Approved decisions*) — splitting `}}}` into three
diagnostics adds noise without information.

**E7. Unclosed opener at end of file.** `library(` with no trailing
newline. `MISSING )` is placed at the file's end byte. Direct parent is
`arguments`; opener is `(` at column 7. Range = `(0, 7)` → end-of-
meaningful-content on line 0 = `(0, 8)`. One column wide because nothing
follows the `(`. Works.

**E8. Comment on opener line.** `f( # comment\n` — opener `(` at col 1,
then `# comment`. End-of-meaningful-content col = 2 (just past the `(`).
Range collapses to just the `(`. Comment is not underlined.

**E9. Trailing whitespace on opener line.** `f(   \n` — opener `(` at
col 1, then three spaces. End-of-meaningful-content col = 2 (just past the
`(`). Range collapses to just the `(`.

**E10. CRLF line endings.** Tree-sitter reports byte columns including
`\r` but `byte_offset_to_utf16_column` strips line endings before
computing UTF-16 columns. The implementation must compute
end-of-meaningful-content using the line's logical content (no `\r`/`\n`).
Add a regression test using `\r\n`.

**E11. No final newline.** `library(` — no `\n` at EOF. The opener's line
is the only line. End-of-meaningful-content col is computed from the line
slice as if EOF were the line terminator. Same code path as E10.

**E12. BOM at start of file.** A UTF-8 BOM (`\xEF\xBB\xBF`) shifts every
byte column by 3. Tree-sitter reports byte columns including the BOM;
`byte_offset_to_utf16_column` accounts for this. All range computations
must go through that helper — no bare `column` field uses.

**E13. Non-ASCII identifiers and emoji.** A line containing `é` or `😀`
before the opener has byte columns > UTF-16 columns. The same
`byte_offset_to_utf16_column` helper handles this. Add explicit tests for
non-ASCII (`é`) and astral-plane (`😀`, which is a UTF-16 surrogate pair —
two code units).

**E14. R Markdown / Quarto code chunks.** Diagnostics already operate on
a per-chunk tree-sitter parse upstream of `collect_syntax_errors`. No
additional handling needed.

**E15. `# @lsp-ignore` suppression.** Both new diagnostics flow through
the same suppression path as existing parse diagnostics. The suppression
marker must be on the line containing the *new* anchor — i.e., the opener
line for the unclosed case, the closer line for the stray case. Documented
in `docs/diagnostics.md`.

## Performance

Worst-case shape: deeply nested unclosed openers (e.g. `f(` repeated N
times). Today's classifier is O(1) per ERROR; the new delimiter scan is
O(direct-children) per ERROR. `collect_syntax_errors` walks each
non-ERROR child recursively but does not recurse into ERROR children, so
the total cost is bounded by O(total ERROR direct children) ≤ O(tokens).
The single-level parent walk for `MISSING` is O(1). No O(N²) hazard.

For defensive measure, the delimiter scan emits at most N diagnostics per
ERROR where N is the number of delimiter tokens. We do not add an
artificial cap; tree-sitter's grammar already bounds this in practice.

## Out of scope

- Unclosed string literal anchoring/messaging — separate issue.
- Backtick-quoted identifier mismatches — backticks aren't brackets.
- Heuristics like "did you mean to add `}` on line N?" — would require
  multi-line layout analysis beyond what's needed.

## Tests

All new tests go in `mod syntax_error_range_tests` in
`crates/raven/src/handlers.rs`, reusing the `collect(code)` helper.

### Stray-closer detection (new)

| Test | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `stray_close_brace_emits_missing_opening` | `"x <- 1\n}\n"` | one diagnostic, message `` Missing opening `{` ``, range on the `}` |
| `stray_close_paren_emits_missing_opening` | `"x <- 1\n)\n"` | one diagnostic, message `` Missing opening `(` ``, range on the `)` |
| `stray_close_bracket_emits_missing_opening` | `"x <- 1\n]\n"` | one diagnostic, message `` Missing opening `[` ``, range on the `]` |
| `stray_double_close_bracket_emits_missing_opening` | `"x <- 1\n]]\n"` | message `` Missing opening `[[` ``, range covers `]]` (width 2) |
| `closer_run_emits_single_diagnostic` | `"}}}"` | exactly ONE diagnostic, message `` Missing opening `{` ``, range spans the whole `}}}` leaf (cols 0-3). Replaces the earlier-considered "three diagnostics" expectation. |
| `mismatched_bracket_still_wins` | `"c(1, 2]"` | existing `Mismatched brackets: …` message; no `Missing opening …` diagnostic |
| `stray_closer_after_valid_expr` | `"f() }"` | one diagnostic on the `}`, none on `f()` |

### Unclosed-opener anchoring

| Test | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `unclosed_paren_anchors_on_opener` | `"x <- mean(c(1, 2, 3)\n\n# comment\n"` | range from `(` of `mean(` (col 9) through end of meaningful content on line 0 (col 20 = end of inner `c(1,2,3)`); message `` Unclosed `(`: missing matching `)` `` |
| `unclosed_brace_anchors_on_opener` | `"f <- function() {\n  x <- 1\n  y <- 2\n"` | range on `{` only (opener at EOL); message `` Unclosed `{`: missing matching `}` `` |
| `unclosed_bracket_anchors_on_opener` | `"vec[1, 2\n"` | range from `[` (col 3) through end of line content (col 8); message `` Unclosed `[`: missing matching `]` `` |
| `unclosed_double_bracket_anchors_on_opener` | `"vec[[1, 2\n"` | range from `[[` start (col 3) through end of line content (col 9); message `` Unclosed `[[`: missing matching `]]` `` |
| `nested_flat_unclosed_emits_per_opener` | `"f(g(h(\n"` | THREE diagnostics, one anchored on each `(`. Ranges: outer `(` cols 1–3, middle `(` cols 3–5, inner `(` cols 5–6 (per the "next opener on same line, or end-of-meaningful-content" rule). Ranges do NOT overlap. |
| `unclosed_paren_at_end_of_file` | `"library("` | range on the `(`; message `` Unclosed `(`: missing matching `)` `` |
| `unclosed_opener_with_trailing_comment` | `"f( # comment\n"` | range covers just the `(` (comment excluded); message `` Unclosed `(`: missing matching `)` `` |
| `unclosed_opener_with_trailing_whitespace` | `"f(   \n"` | range covers just the `(` (whitespace excluded); message `` Unclosed `(`: missing matching `)` `` |

### Coalescing — wrong closer for the surrounding opener

These cover both parse shapes (flat ERROR and `arguments`-with-MISSING).
Both shapes coalesce into a single `Mismatched brackets` diagnostic.

| Test | Input | Parse shape | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wrong_closer_flat_error_coalesces` | `"f(}\n"` | flat ERROR contains both `(` and `ERROR("}")` | exactly ONE diagnostic via delimiter-scan mismatched-bracket sub-rule. Message `` Mismatched brackets: `(` opened here; close with `)` not `}`. ``, range on the `}` |
| `wrong_closer_in_arguments_coalesces` | `"f(} y\n"` | `arguments(`(`, ERROR(`}`), argument, MISSING `)`)` | exactly ONE diagnostic via the arguments-coalescing rule. No `Unclosed `(`` follow-up for the same opener (suppressed by `CollectState::covered_openers`). |
| `wrong_closer_for_subset_coalesces` | `"vec[}\n"` | (flat ERROR — verify in test) | one Mismatched-brackets diagnostic naming `[` and `}` |
| `wrong_closer_with_braced_expression` | `"function() ]\n"` | `function_definition` with `braced_expression` followed by stray `]` (verify exact shape) | Specific to the parse shape: if `]` is in `braced_expression`, coalesces against `{`; otherwise stays as a stray closer (`` Missing opening `[` ``). Test asserts whichever the verified parse shape produces. |
| `mixed_closer_leaf_emits_per_kind` | `"]\n)"` placed as two separate stray closers OR `f(])` whose flat ERROR contains a leaf `])` | For mixed leaves like `])`: two diagnostics, one `` Missing opening `[` `` on the `]`, one `` Missing opening `(` `` on the `)`. |

### Encoding / line-ending edge cases

| Test | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `unclosed_opener_crlf` | `"library(\r\n"` | range computed correctly (no `\r` in range), single diagnostic |
| `unclosed_opener_no_final_newline` | `"library("` | works without EOF newline |
| `unclosed_opener_with_bom` | `"\u{FEFF}library("` | UTF-16 col reflects BOM stripped; range valid |
| `unclosed_opener_non_ascii_before` | `"é_func("` | UTF-16 col for `(` reflects single-code-unit `é`; range valid |
| `unclosed_opener_astral_before` | `"😀_func("` | UTF-16 col for `(` accounts for the surrogate pair (`😀` = 2 code units); range valid |

### Regression / non-regression

| Test | Behavior to preserve / change |
|---|---|
| `unclosed_paren_diagnostic_anchors_on_offending_line` (existing) | Rewrite to expect new anchor (on opener) instead of end-of-statement. |
| `mismatched_bracket_emits_descriptive_message` (existing) | Unchanged behavior. |
| `incomplete_assignment_in_block_minimized` (existing) | Unchanged — non-bracket `MISSING`, uses unchanged code path. |
| `top_level_incomplete_assignment` (existing) | Unchanged (same reason). |
| `unclosed_string_literal_*` (existing) | Unchanged — string-literal handling untouched. |
| `prop_missing_node_priority` (handlers.rs:7802) | Unchanged — asserts on `"Syntax error"`-message count, not on `Missing X` ranges. Our new messages don't affect this property. |
| `prop_missing_node_width` (handlers.rs:8098) | **Update**: the property currently asserts that every diagnostic at a `MISSING` node's reported position has width 1. The new design anchors *bracket-kind* `MISSING` on the opener (not the MISSING position) with a multi-column range. The fix is to scope the property: filter `missing_positions` to exclude bracket-kind closers (`)`, `}`, `]`, `]]`), keeping the width-1 assertion only for non-bracket `MISSING` kinds (e.g. identifiers, operators). Add a parallel property asserting that bracket-kind `MISSING` produces a diagnostic anchored on the opener, with range ending at end-of-meaningful-content. |
| `prop_diagnostic_deduplication` (handlers.rs:7951), `prop_error_detection_completeness` (handlers.rs:8199) | Verify in implementation that these still pass; they don't assert specific messages or anchor positions. |

### Helper-level unit tests

Add unit tests for the new helpers:

- `find_opener_for_missing(missing: Node, text: &str) -> Option<(Node, Range)>`
  — covers `MISSING` inside `arguments` (with `(`/`[`/`[[` opener), inside
  `braced_expression`, inside `parenthesized_expression`, and the
  defensive `None` case.
- `end_of_meaningful_content(line: &str) -> u32` — covers: trailing
  whitespace only, trailing comment only, content + trailing comment,
  content + trailing whitespace, `#` inside a string literal (must NOT
  trim there — comment detection is string-aware), `#` inside a
  backtick-quoted identifier (must NOT trim there), CRLF (`\r` is
  whitespace, must be trimmed).
- Delimiter-scan event extraction — covers: opener tokens as direct
  children of an ERROR, closer tokens as direct children, homogeneous
  closer-run leaves (`}}}` → one event), mixed closer-run leaves (`])`
  → two events), nested ERROR leaves, non-delimiter children that are
  skipped (identifiers, literals, comments).

## Documentation

`docs/diagnostics.md` — replace the current row:

```text
| `Missing )` / `Missing ]` / etc. | A delimiter was opened but never closed (`library(`) |
```

with two rows:

```text
| `` Unclosed `(`: missing matching `)` `` / `` Unclosed `{`: missing matching `}` `` / `` Unclosed `[`: missing matching `]` `` / `` Unclosed `[[`: missing matching `]]` `` | A delimiter was opened but never closed (`library(`, `function() {`). The diagnostic is anchored on the opening delimiter, spanning to the end of meaningful content on that line. |
| `` Missing opening `{` `` / `` Missing opening `(` `` / `` Missing opening `[` `` / `` Missing opening `[[` `` | A closing delimiter appears with no matching opener (`}` at top level, `)` after a complete expression). A run of stray closers (`}}}`) reports a single diagnostic for the whole run. |
```

Also note that the existing `` Mismatched brackets: … `` row's coverage
extends to the `f(}` case (wrong closer immediately inside an unclosed
opener).

No changes to `docs/development.md` — the new logic is local to
`handlers.rs` and doesn't affect cross-file invariants, caching, or any
architectural concerns covered there. No `CLAUDE.md` updates — the
changes don't add a new module-spanning invariant.
