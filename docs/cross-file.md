# Cross-File & Package Awareness

Raven builds a dependency graph of your R project and uses it to provide scope-aware completions, diagnostics, and navigation across file boundaries. This page explains how the system works.

## How It Works

Most R projects consist of multiple files connected by `source()` calls. Raven detects these relationships automatically:

```r
# main.R
library(dplyr)
source("utils.R")
result <- helper_function(42)  # Raven knows this comes from utils.R
```

```r
# utils.R
helper_function <- function(x) { x * 2 }
```

When you open a file in a workspace with detectable `source()` patterns, Raven:
1. Scans the workspace for `source()` calls and builds a dependency graph
2. Resolves which symbols are available at each position in each file
3. Provides completions, diagnostics, hover, and go-to-definition using the full graph

This happens automatically for standard `source()` patterns.

## Automatic source() Detection

Raven detects `source()` and `sys.source()` calls:
- Single and double quotes: `source("path.R")` or `source('path.R')`
- Named arguments: `source(file = "path.R")`
- `local = TRUE` and `chdir = TRUE` parameters
- `source(system.file("helper.R", package = "pkg"))` — the `system.file()` path is resolved statically: for the package being analyzed it maps to the source-tree `inst/` directory, and for an installed package it is found under the library paths (so a helper sourced this way contributes its definitions like any other `source()` target). Resolution tracks package lifecycle events live: installing or removing the referenced package mid-session, or renaming the workspace package in `DESCRIPTION`, re-resolves these edges without editing the file or restarting
- Dynamic paths (variables, expressions) are skipped gracefully

`sys.source()` defaults to a non-global environment, so its symbols are treated as local and do **not** propagate to the calling file unless you pass `envir = globalenv()` (or `.GlobalEnv`).

**`local = TRUE` inheritance.** `source("child.R", local = TRUE)` evaluates the child in the environment from which `source()` is called. At the **top level** of a script that environment is the global environment, so the child sees all of the parent's bindings defined before the call — exactly like the default `local = FALSE` — and Raven resolves the parent's earlier definitions in the child accordingly. Only when the `source(local = TRUE)` call sits **inside a function body** does the child bind to that function's frame rather than the globals; in that case the child does not inherit the parent's top-level symbols through the relationship (declared symbols from `# raven: var` directives still flow). The child's *own* new definitions never leak back out to the parent's global scope under `local = TRUE`.

**Case-only filename mismatches.** On macOS and Windows, `source("helpers.r")` resolves to an on-disk `helpers.R` (and vice versa): Raven matches the resolved path to the real directory entry's capitalization, so the sourced file's symbols are found regardless of the case used in the `source()` string. On case-sensitive filesystems (typical Linux) `source("helpers.r")` would not find `helpers.R` at runtime — but rather than drop the file from the graph and bury the real problem under a flood of false `undefined-variable` warnings, Raven resolves the single case-insensitive match into the graph anyway and reports the case mismatch once, at the `source()` call. Either way Raven flags it as [`source-path-case-mismatch`](diagnostics.md#source-path-case-mismatch) (information on a case-insensitive filesystem, warning on a case-sensitive one). See [Path Resolution → Case-only mismatches](#case-only-mismatches) for the exact rules (exact match always wins; an ambiguous 2+-match stays unresolved).

Raven also provides **file path intellisense** inside `source()` strings and path-taking directives: completion for `.R`/`.r` files and directories, and cmd-click navigation to the target file.

For dynamic or conditional paths that Raven can't detect, use [directives](directives.md) to declare relationships explicitly.

### R Markdown / Quarto chunks

Inside `.Rmd` / `.qmd` documents, only R chunk bodies feed cross-file analysis — prose and YAML front matter are masked out before detection. A `source()` or `library()` call written in a chunk participates exactly as it would in a `.R` file; the same text in prose is ignored. Within a single document, bindings from earlier chunks are visible in later chunks (ordered-concatenation semantics) — define `x` in chunk 1 and it resolves in chunk 3. A `.R` file may also declare `# raven: sourced-by report.Rmd`, in which case Raven reads the report's chunks to supply that file's inherited scope. `.Rmd` / `.qmd` files are not added to the proactive workspace scan, so the editor sees these relationships when the Rmd is open or when a `.R` file points at it via a backward directive. See [R Code Chunks](./chunks.md#cross-file-resolution-from-chunks).

## Package Awareness

Raven recognizes `library()`, `require()`, and `loadNamespace()` calls and makes package exports available for completions, hover, and diagnostics.

> [!TIP]
> **Developing an R package?** When Raven detects a `DESCRIPTION` file at the workspace root, it switches to package mode — all `R/*.R` files become mutually visible without `source()` calls, and `@import`/`@importFrom` annotations suppress undefined-variable diagnostics. See [R Package Development](r-package-dev.md).

Workspace-root startup files are modeled separately from package mode. If your
project `.Rprofile` defines helpers, attaches packages, or sources setup files,
see [`.Rprofile` Startup Prelude](rprofile.md).

### How It Works

When you write `library(dplyr)`, Raven:
1. Detects the call and extracts the package name
2. Resolves the package's exported symbols — usually by reading its installed `NAMESPACE` file directly, with no R involved (see [When Raven calls R](#when-raven-calls-r) for the cases that need a subprocess)
3. Makes those symbols available with `{dplyr}` attribution in completions
4. Suppresses "undefined variable" warnings for package exports

### When Raven calls R

Raven's analysis is static: it parses your code and your installed packages' `NAMESPACE` files without a running R session. It does, however, launch a short-lived, non-interactive R subprocess — the `R` on your `PATH`, or [`raven.packages.rPath`](configuration.md#package-settings) — in two situations. These are Raven's own processes; they never touch your interactive R session, and when no R is found Raven falls back gracefully.

**1. To find where your packages are installed.** Raven runs `.libPaths()` to discover your library directories. Where packages live depends on your R installation, version, and project setup — including [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) project-local libraries, which Raven activates before reading the paths — so there's no reliable way to determine it statically. Without R, Raven falls back to the standard platform install locations plus any [`raven.packages.additionalLibraryPaths`](configuration.md#package-settings), which may miss user- or project-local libraries.

**2. To expand exports that can't be read from `NAMESPACE` text.** Most packages list their exports with explicit `export(name)` directives, which Raven reads straight from the installed `NAMESPACE` file — no R required. But a package can instead (or additionally) declare `exportPattern("<regex>")`: "export every object in my namespace whose name matches this regex." Raven can't expand that from the file alone — it would need to know every object the namespace actually defines once loaded — so for these packages it asks R via `getNamespaceExports()`. Several base R packages use `exportPattern`, as do a minority of installed CRAN packages. When R isn't available, Raven approximates their exports from the package's `INDEX` file plus any explicit `export()` entries; this covers documented functions but may miss pattern-only or dynamically generated symbols.

Run **Raven: Refresh package cache** after changing `.libPaths()` or running `renv::activate()` to re-run these queries.

### Resolving exports without R

When a package can't be found in any local library path — typically in CI, where `.libPaths()` is empty — Raven still resolves its **export names** through an ordered three-tier fallback, consulted per package. The trigger is a **missing package directory**, not a missing R: the fallback applies only when the package isn't found on disk at all. A package that *is* installed still resolves from Tier 1 even with no R (its `exportPattern` exports just degrade to the `INDEX` approximation, as above).

1. **Tier 1 — installed.** The authoritative path above: parse the installed `NAMESPACE`, expanding `exportPattern` via R when reachable (and approximating from `INDEX` when not). Version-exact to the install.
2. **Tier 2 — repo database.** A committed, repo-specific `.raven/packages.json` you generate with [`raven packages freeze`](cli.md#raven-packages-freeze). It is "frozen Tier 1": full structure (exports, `Depends`, datasets) captured through the authoritative path, version-exact to when it was generated.
3. **Tier 3 — `names.db` database.** Raven's `names.db` database, built **append-only** from a reference-R capture ∪ CRAN + Bioconductor (via [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev)), keeping the **highest version** of each package. It isn't bundled with the binary; install it with `raven packages update` for broad CRAN/Bioconductor coverage. Carries exports, `Depends`, and dataset names — no `:::` internals or signatures.

Tier 2 outranks Tier 3 because it is project-specific and built through the authoritative path; a repo that never generates a Tier 2 file still works in CI via Tier 3 alone when the database is present. Tiers 2 and 3 carry **export names, `Depends`, and datasets only** — no `:::` internal objects and no function signatures, which still require a local install (Tier 1). This fallback feeds **export resolution** only; it never changes a package's install status (see [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md#package-names-vs-install-status)). The full model, fidelity caveats, and how to generate the repo database are in [Package database](package-database.md).

### Base Packages

Base R packages are always available without explicit `library()` calls: **base**, **methods**, **utils**, **grDevices**, **graphics**, **stats**, **datasets**. Raven uses this fixed list directly — it does not query R to discover the base packages. The R subprocess is queried for *installed user packages* (via the library paths), not to determine which base packages exist — though base-package *exports* are still expanded via R, since they use `exportPattern` (see [When Raven calls R](#when-raven-calls-r)).

Lazy-loaded datasets are a related special case. Packages expose data objects — `mtcars` and `iris` from the base `datasets` package, `flights` from **nycflights13**, `diamonds` from **ggplot2** — that appear in neither `NAMESPACE` `export()` lines nor `getNamespaceExports()`. How Raven discovers them depends on whether the package uses R's LazyData mechanism:

- **LazyData packages** (those whose `DESCRIPTION` sets `LazyData: true`, identifiable by the presence of `data/Rdata.rdb`) build a single binary database of all data objects. Their `data/` file stems don't reliably list object names — a package like **survival** ships `lung` with no `data/lung.rda` file — so Raven queries the R subprocess via `data(package = "pkg")$results` to enumerate the authoritative set. Without R the static file-stem walk is used as a fallback (reduced fidelity).
- **Non-LazyData packages** store datasets as individual `.rda`/`.RData` files in `data/`. Raven walks those files and the `INDEX` file statically, with no subprocess needed.

Base-package datasets are always available (auto-attached at startup); a non-base package's datasets become available after its `library()` call, exactly like its function exports, and resolve transitively through `Depends` and meta-packages (`library(tidyverse); diamonds`).

`data()` calls bind a dataset's objects from the call onward, mirroring R. `data(api, package = "survey")` puts every object that the package's `api` data file binds — `apiclus1`, `apistrat`, … — in scope, even when a single data file ships several differently-named objects (the file stem and the object names differ). Because R loads those objects into the calling environment, a `data()` call overwrites earlier same-named bindings in that environment; later assignments can overwrite the data objects again. The bare form `data(api)` (no `package =`) searches the packages attached at-or-before the call and then the default-attached base packages, binding the objects from the first package that provides the dataset — mirroring R, where the first search-path hit wins and attached packages sit ahead of base packages. (Raven doesn't track attachment order, so when several attached packages provide the same dataset the alphabetically-first one is attributed.) The literal argument (`api`) is always bound too, so the behavior degrades gracefully when R is unavailable. Resolving the *object* names (beyond the file stem) requires a `data/` enumeration, captured when the package is loaded; `raven check` warms the packages named in `data(package = …)` for this. A package's namespace-internal `sysdata.rda` objects (e.g. `cli`'s internal `emojis` table) are never exposed this way — `library(cli)` followed by `emojis` is still a real R error and Raven flags it correctly.

> **Parent-file `data()` scope limit.** When a child file inherits its parent's scope via `# raven: sourced-by` (or auto-inferred backward dependency), `data()` alias expansion — the mapping from file stem to the individual object names — is not propagated through the backward parent-prefix walk. The literal stem bound by the `data()` call in the parent *does* flow to the child, so the most commonly used name resolves. Only the expanded aliases (e.g. `apiclus1` / `apistrat` from `data(api)`) may be missing in the child's scope view. Forward `source()` children receive full expansion. To work around this in a child file, repeat the `data()` call there, or use a [`# raven: var` directive](directives.md#declaration-directives) to declare the alias names explicitly.

### `devtools::load_all()` — Virtual Attached Package

`devtools::load_all()` / `pkgload::load_all()` (and a bare `load_all()`) is modeled as attaching the package under development. Raven makes the package's internal symbols — exported and non-exported `R/` definitions, `R/sysdata.rda` objects, names bound in `.onLoad`/`.onAttach`, and NAMESPACE imports — available from the call onward, exactly as `library()` makes installed-package exports available.

The propagation follows the same rules as `library()`:

- **Position-aware** — symbols surface only after the `load_all()` call.
- **Forward-propagating** — a `source()` child whose parent calls `load_all()` inherits the internals; a parent does not pick them up from a child's `load_all()`.
- **Transitive** — propagates through multi-hop `source()` chains.
- **Multi-parent union** — when a file has multiple parents and at least one calls `load_all()`, the internals are available in the child too.

A workspace-root `.Rprofile` that calls `load_all()` surfaces the package internals in ordinary scripts. In package mode, `R/` source files, package tests, and built-documentation directories do not receive the `.Rprofile`-route internals (they already get them through the package-mode dev context). See [`.Rprofile` Startup Prelude](rprofile.md).

A file **outside the package workspace root** that calls `load_all()` does NOT pick up the package internals — this avoids muting real diagnostics in unrelated scratch files.

Unlike `library(yourpkg)`, `load_all()` exposes internals even when they are not exported, matching `load_all()`'s own `export_all = TRUE` default. See [R Package Development](r-package-dev.md#scripts-that-call-devtoolsload_all) for more.

### Position-Aware Loading

Package exports are only available after the `library()` call:

```r
mutate(df, x = 1)  # Warning: undefined variable 'mutate'
library(dplyr)
mutate(df, y = 2)  # OK: dplyr is now loaded
```

### Function-Scoped Loading

When `library()` is called inside a function, exports are only available within that function's scope:

```r
my_analysis <- function(data) {
  library(dplyr)
  mutate(data, x = 1)  # OK: dplyr available inside function
}
mutate(df, y = 2)  # Warning: dplyr not available at global scope
```

### Meta-Package Support

Raven recognizes meta-packages that attach multiple packages:

- **tidyverse** attaches: dplyr, readr, forcats, stringr, ggplot2, tibble, lubridate, tidyr, purrr
- **tidymodels** attaches: broom, dials, dplyr, ggplot2, infer, modeldata, parsnip, purrr, recipes, rsample, tibble, tidyr, tune, workflows, workflowsets, yardstick

### Availability vs. ownership

A symbol made visible through a meta-package, an attached package, or a `Depends` chain has two distinct package answers that Raven keeps separate:

- **Availability** — *which loaded package made this visible?* This is what suppresses "undefined variable" warnings. `library(tidyverse)` makes `mutate` available because Raven aggregates the exports of tidyverse's attached members.
- **Ownership** — *which package actually contributes the symbol?* This is the **documentation / help owner** (used for hover help, the help panel, signature help, and completion detail) and the **NSE-policy owner** (used to classify data-masking arguments). For `mutate` under `library(tidyverse)`, the owner is `dplyr`.

This matters because `help("mutate", package = "tidyverse")` is empty — only `dplyr` owns the topic. So `library(tidyverse); mutate(...)` stays *available* through tidyverse but resolves hover, help, signatures, completion detail, and NSE policy against `dplyr`. A direct `library(dplyr)` and an explicit `dplyr::mutate(...)` resolve to `dplyr` as before, and a genuine package export is always owned by the package that exports it (the aggregate root wins for its own exports). When no contributing owner can be resolved, existing not-found behavior is unchanged.

### Cross-File Package Propagation

Packages loaded in parent files are available in sourced children:

```r
# main.R
library(dplyr)
source("analysis.R")  # dplyr available in analysis.R
library(ggplot2)      # NOT available in analysis.R (loaded after source)
```

Packages loaded in child files do NOT propagate back to parents (forward-only).

### Supported Call Patterns

| Pattern | Supported |
|---|---|
| `library(pkgname)` | Yes |
| `library("pkgname")` | Yes |
| `require(pkgname)` | Yes |
| `loadNamespace("pkgname")` | Yes |
| `library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)` | No (dynamic) |
| `sapply(c("a","b"), library, character.only = TRUE)` | Yes (apply family) |
| `sapply(libs, library, character.only = TRUE)` where `libs <- c("a","b")` | Yes (same-file variable) |
| `purrr::map(c("a","b"), library, character.only = TRUE)` | Yes (purrr family) |
| `sapply(paste0(...), library, character.only = TRUE)` | No (dynamic vector) |

### Apply-Family Loads

Raven also recognizes package loads expressed through apply-family calls when
all the package names are statically determinable:

```r
libs <- c("dplyr", "tidyr")
sapply(libs, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

This works for `sapply`, `lapply`, `vapply`, `mapply`, and the purrr forms
(`map`, `walk`, `map_chr`, etc., bare or `purrr::`-qualified). The package
vector must be either an inline `c("a","b",...)` of string literals, or a
same-file variable assigned exactly once via `<-`, `=`, or `assign()` to such
a literal vector. `character.only = TRUE` must be present (without it, R
itself would not load the strings as packages). Dynamic constructions such as
`paste0(...)`, `tolower(x)`, `c(libs1, libs2)`, function-parameter origins,
or values defined in another file are silently ignored.

### Keeping Packages in Sync

Raven watches `.libPaths()` directories and invalidates caches when packages are installed, upgraded, or removed. If the watcher misses a change (e.g., after `renv::activate()`), run **Raven: Refresh package cache** from the command palette.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for watcher settings (`packages.watchLibraryPaths`, `packages.watchDebounceMs`).

## NSE directive propagation

`# raven: nse` declarations (see [Non-Standard Evaluation](non-standard-evaluation.md) and [directives](directives.md#nse-declarations)) are cross-file facts, like defined symbols and `library()` loads: a declaration governs undefined-variable suppression for its named callee in every file connected to it through the resolved `source()` graph, in both directions and transitively. Declare a helper's NSE contract once — next to its `library()` call, its definition, or in a sourced setup file — and the corresponding false positives are suppressed at call sites in the connected files.

Propagation reuses the same dependency graph and path-resolution rules (`# raven: cd`, workspace-root fallback, `max_chain_depth`) as the scope and package facts above; backward directives participate as ordinary edges but gain no extra path fallback. The propagation set is the revalidation-consistent neighborhood — a file's ancestors plus the descendant subtrees of itself and its ancestors — so editing a `# raven: nse` (or a `# raven: func` whose formals feed cross-file positional matching) in any connected file revalidates the dependents that rely on it. Cross-file propagation is intentionally **coarse and file-level**: a propagated directive ignores its original line and governs the whole connected file, and it is consulted below the precise built-in NSE policy tables so it cannot coarsen a known verb. Two unconnected files never share NSE directives.

## Self-contained sourced files (`# raven: self-contained`)

By default a file's cross-file scope includes a **backward** contribution: the
bindings visible at every `source()` call that pulls the file in. For ordinary
script fragments, that matches R's dynamic behavior: the file may intentionally
use variables created by its caller.

Some sourced files are different. A shared helper or setup file may be
self-contained: it defines its own inputs, loads its own packages, and sources
its own helper chain. The header directive `# raven: self-contained`
(alias: `# raven: standalone`) opts that file out of the backward caller
contribution. Raven resolves it **in isolation** from callers, while still
letting its own definitions and `library()` loads flow forward to every caller.

This is both more precise and faster for true source hubs. In deeply nested,
high-fan-out graphs - for example, a setup file sourced by dozens of scripts
that itself sources dozens of files through a nested chain - the directive can
let Raven reuse one caller-independent scope instead of re-resolving the same
closure in many caller contexts.

See [Speeding Up Cross-File Analysis](cross-file-analysis-performance.md) for when to use
`# raven: self-contained`, and [Directives](directives.md#self-contained-sourced-files)
for the exact syntax. `# raven: nse` / `# raven: func` propagation over
`source()` edges is unaffected (it is graph-level, not scope-level).

## Position-Aware Scope

Symbols from sourced files are only available **after** the `source()` call:

```r
x <- 1
source("a.R")  # Symbols from a.R available after this line
y <- foo()     # foo() from a.R is now in scope
```

This applies to both `source()` calls and forward directives. The scope model aims to reflect runtime availability for the statically determinable cases — see [Symbol Recognition](#symbol-recognition) below for what's covered.

## Symbol Recognition

Raven recognizes these R constructs as definitions:

- `name <- expr` / `name <<- expr` / `expr -> name` / `expr ->> name`
- `name = expr` (in assignment context)
- `assign("name", expr)` (string-literal only)

For dynamically-created symbols (`eval()`, `load()`, dynamic `assign()`), use [declaration directives](directives.md#declaration-directives).

### Symbol Removal (rm/remove)

Raven tracks `rm()` and `remove()` calls to maintain accurate scope:

```r
x <- 1
rm(x)
x  # Warning: undefined variable
```

Supported: `rm(x)`, `rm(x, y)`, `rm(list = c("x", "y"))`. Dynamic patterns like `rm(list = ls())` are skipped.

## How This Feeds Into Features

The dependency graph and scope model power several features:

- **[Diagnostics](diagnostics.md)** — undefined variable warnings respect cross-file scope and loaded packages
- **[Completions](completion.md)** — symbols from sourced files and packages appear with source attribution
- **[Find References](find-references.md)** — locates occurrences by name across all open and indexed files (a flat name match, *not* dependency-graph-scoped)
- **Go-to-definition** — navigates to definitions in other files
- **Hover** — shows where a symbol is defined and which package it comes from

## Advanced

### Backward Dependency Modes

The `raven.crossFile.backwardDependencies` setting controls how Raven discovers which files source the current file.

**`"auto"` (default):** Raven scans the workspace for `source()` calls and infers backward relationships automatically. No `# raven: sourced-by` directives needed. Diagnostics are deferred until the workspace scan completes to avoid false positives.

**`"explicit"`:** Only relationships declared via `# raven: sourced-by` directives are used. Use this if auto-inference produces unwanted results (e.g., a file sourced by multiple parents with conflicting scopes).

**Per-file opt-out:** Adding an explicit `# raven: sourced-by` directive to a file disables auto-inference for that file.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the setting.

### Traversal budgets in large workspaces

Cross-file resolution walks the `source()` dependency graph under two safety budgets that bound analysis cost on pathologically dense graphs:

- **`raven.crossFile.maxTransitiveDependentsVisited`** (default `50000`) — the maximum number of files visited while building a file's dependency neighborhood.
- **`raven.crossFile.maxChainDepth`** (default `64`) — the maximum traversal depth.

The defaults are sized so realistic workspaces never reach them (the neighborhood is naturally bounded by the workspace's file count). If a workspace is large and dense enough to exhaust a budget, Raven stops following some `source()` edges, and the symbols those files define can surface as **false-positive `undefined-variable` warnings**. When that happens:

- In the editor, Raven shows a throttled warning naming the setting to raise.
- `raven check` prints a one-line note (grouped with the diagnostics on stdout for the default `text` output, or on stderr for `json`/`sarif` — see [Output streams](cli.md#output-streams)), so budget-induced drops are distinguishable from genuine undefined variables in CI.

Raise the relevant setting in `raven.toml` to analyze more of the graph. See [Configuration](configuration.md).

### Path Resolution

When Raven resolves a relative path to another file, the base directory depends on where the path came from:

- **Forward directives** (`# raven: source`, `# raven: run`, `# raven: include`) and **AST-detected `source()` calls** resolve relative to the directory of the file they appear in, and honor an in-effect [`# raven: cd`](directives.md) working directory.
- **Backward directives** (`# raven: sourced-by`, `# raven: run-by`, `# raven: included-by`) resolve relative to the file's own directory and **ignore `# raven: cd`**.
- **Workspace-root fallback** applies to AST-detected `source()` calls and forward directives (`# raven: source`, `# raven: run`, `# raven: include`), and only when no working directory (an explicit `# raven: cd` or one inherited from a parent file) is in effect: a path that doesn't resolve relative to the file's directory is then also tried relative to the workspace root. Forward directives are semantically equivalent to `source()` calls, so they resolve identically across dependency edges, scope, missing-file diagnostics, cmd-click, and path completion. The fallback never applies to backward directives.

#### Case-only mismatches

For a forward `source()`/directive path, an **exact-case match always wins**. If the path doesn't match exactly but differs from the real on-disk filename **only by case** (`source("scripts/templates.r")` for an on-disk `templates.R`), Raven resolves it to the real file anyway — provided there is exactly one case-insensitive match — so the file enters the source graph and its symbols stay visible. This holds uniformly across dependency edges, scope, diagnostics, cmd-click, and path completion. Raven also reports it once at the `source()` line as [`source-path-case-mismatch`](diagnostics.md#source-path-case-mismatch) (information on a case-insensitive filesystem, warning on a case-sensitive one). If two on-disk files match the path case-insensitively — only possible on a case-sensitive filesystem — the path is ambiguous and stays unresolved (`unresolved-source-path`). Matching is ASCII-only, and this leniency is forward-only: backward directives resolve by exact case.

### Global Symbol Hoisting

R has late-binding semantics — a function can reference another function that hasn't been defined yet at the time of the function's *definition*, as long as it exists by the time the function is *called*:

```r
main <- function() {
  helper()  # helper doesn't exist yet, but will when main() is called
}
helper <- function() { 42 }
main()  # works fine
```

Raven supports this by hoisting global definitions inside function bodies. When the cursor is inside a function body, all global definitions are visible regardless of position. Function-local variables remain strictly positional.

This is enabled by default. Disable with the LSP init option `crossFile.hoistGlobalsInFunctions: false` — this one is init-only and is not exposed in the VS Code Settings UI (see [Configuration](configuration.md)).

### $ and @ Member Resolution

When you cmd-click on `foo$bar` (or `foo@slot` for S4 objects), Raven resolves the member against `foo` — not as a free variable. It looks for:
- Member assignments: `foo$bar <- …`, `foo["bar"] <- …`, or `foo[["bar"]] <- …` (the string-subscript forms apply to `$` only); `foo@slot <- …` for S4 slots.
- Constructor-literal members: named arguments in constructors such as `list()`, `c()`, `data.frame()`, `tibble()`, `data.table()`, `environment()`, `list2env()`, and `new()`.

Scope-aware completions after `$` use the same rules: typing `foo$` offers known members of `foo`.
