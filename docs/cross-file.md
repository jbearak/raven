# Cross-File Awareness

Raven understands relationships between R source files through `source()` calls and special comment directives, providing accurate symbol resolution, diagnostics, and navigation across file boundaries.

## Automatic source() Detection

The LSP automatically detects `source()` and `sys.source()` calls:
- Supports both single and double quotes: `source("path.R")` or `source('path.R')`
- Handles named arguments: `source(file = "path.R")`
- Detects `local = TRUE` and `chdir = TRUE` parameters
- Skips dynamic paths (variables, expressions) gracefully

## LSP Directives

All directives must appear on their own comment line (starting with `#`, optionally indented). They are not recognized in trailing comments like `x <- 1 # @lsp-source file.R`. The one exception is `@lsp-ignore`, which can be used as a trailing comment to suppress diagnostics on the same line (e.g., `x <- foo # @lsp-ignore`).

All directives support optional colon and quotes: `# @lsp-sourced-by: "../main.R"` is equivalent to `# @lsp-sourced-by ../main.R`.

**Header-only directives:** Backward directives (`@lsp-sourced-by` and synonyms) and working directory directives (`@lsp-cd` and synonyms) must appear in the **file header** — the region of consecutive blank and comment lines at the top of the file, before any code. They are ignored if they appear after the first line of code. This matches the Sight reference implementation. Forward directives, declaration directives, and ignore directives can appear anywhere in the file.

### Backward Directives

Declare that this file is sourced by another file:
```r
# @lsp-sourced-by ../main.R
# @lsp-run-by ../main.R        # synonym
# @lsp-included-by ../main.R   # synonym
```

Optional parameters:
- `line=N` - Specify 1-based line number in parent where source() call occurs
- `match="pattern"` - Specify text pattern to find source() call in parent

Example with line number:
```r
# @lsp-sourced-by ../main.R line=15
my_function <- function(x) { x + 1 }
```

Example with match pattern:
```r
# @lsp-sourced-by ../main.R match="source("
# The LSP will search for "source(" in main.R and use the first match
# on a line containing a source() call to this file
```

**Call-site inference:** When neither `line=` nor `match=` is specified, the LSP will scan the parent file for `source()` or `sys.source()` calls that reference this file and use the first match as the call site. If no match is found, the configured default (`assumeCallSite`) is used.

### Forward Directives

Explicitly declare that this file sources another file (useful for dynamic or conditional paths):
```r
# @lsp-source utils/helpers.R
# @lsp-run utils/helpers.R        # synonym
# @lsp-include utils/helpers.R    # synonym
```

All syntax variations are supported:
- With or without colon: `@lsp-source: path` or `@lsp-source path`
- With quotes: `@lsp-source "path/with spaces.R"` or `@lsp-source 'path.R'`
- Without quotes: `@lsp-source path.R`

Optional `line=N` parameter specifies the call-site (1-based line number):
```r
# @lsp-source utils/helpers.R line=25
# Symbols from helpers.R become available at line 25 (not at this directive's line)
```

When `line=N` is omitted, symbols become available after the directive's own line.

**Path resolution:** Forward directives use `@lsp-cd` for path resolution (unlike backward directives which ignore it). This matches the behavior of `source()` calls, since forward directives are semantically equivalent to `source()` calls.

### Working Directory Directives

Set working directory context for path resolution:
```r
# @lsp-working-directory /data/scripts
# @lsp-working-dir /data/scripts     # synonym
# @lsp-current-directory /data/scripts  # synonym
# @lsp-current-dir /data/scripts     # synonym
# @lsp-wd /data/scripts              # synonym
# @lsp-cd /data/scripts              # synonym
```

Path resolution:
- Paths starting with `/` are workspace-root-relative (e.g., `/data` -> `<workspace>/data`)
- Other paths are file-relative (e.g., `../shared` -> parent directory's `shared`)

#### Critical: @lsp-cd Affects Forward Directives and source() Only

| Directive Type | Examples | Uses @lsp-cd? | Rationale |
|----------------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Forward** | `@lsp-source`, `@lsp-run`, `@lsp-include` | **YES** | Semantically equivalent to `source()` calls |
| **Backward** | `@lsp-sourced-by`, `@lsp-run-by`, `@lsp-included-by` | **NO** | Describes static file relationships |
| **source() calls** | `source("file.R")` | **YES** | Runtime behavior affected by working directory |

**Why this distinction?**
- **Forward directives** and **source() calls** describe runtime execution behavior. They are semantically equivalent to R's `source()` function, which is affected by the current working directory at runtime.
- **Backward directives** describe static file relationships from the child's perspective. They declare "this file is sourced by that parent file" - a relationship that should NOT change based on runtime working directory.

**Example:**
```r
# File: subdir/child.R
# @lsp-cd /some/other/directory
# @lsp-run-by ../parent.R      # Resolves to parent.R in workspace root (ignores @lsp-cd)
# @lsp-source utils.R          # Resolves to /some/other/directory/utils.R (uses @lsp-cd)

source("helpers.R")            # Resolves to /some/other/directory/helpers.R (uses @lsp-cd)
```

### Working Directory Inheritance

When a child file uses a backward directive (`@lsp-sourced-by`, `@lsp-run-by`, `@lsp-included-by`) without its own explicit `@lsp-cd`, it inherits the working directory from its parent file. This enables accurate `source()` path resolution in child files that are run from a parent's working directory context.

**Precedence rules:**
1. Explicit `@lsp-cd` in the child file takes precedence (no inheritance)
2. If no explicit `@lsp-cd`, the child inherits from its parent's effective working directory
3. Inheritance is transitive: if the parent also inherits, the chain is followed

**Example:**
```r
# parent.R
# @lsp-cd /data/project
source("child.R")  # Resolves to /data/project/child.R
```

```r
# child.R
# @lsp-run-by ../parent.R
# No explicit @lsp-cd, so inherits /data/project from parent
source("utils.R")  # Resolves to /data/project/utils.R (not relative to child.R's directory)
```

**Effect on source() resolution:** The inherited working directory affects how `source()` calls in the child file resolve their paths. This matches R's runtime behavior when a parent script sets the working directory before sourcing a child.

### Diagnostic Suppression

```r
# @lsp-ignore           # Suppress diagnostics on current line
# @lsp-ignore-next      # Suppress diagnostics on next line
x <- foo # @lsp-ignore  # Also works as a trailing comment
```

`@lsp-ignore` is the only directive that can appear as a trailing comment. All other directives must be on their own comment line.

### Declaration Directives

See [Declaration Directives](declaration-directives.md) for declaring dynamically-created symbols (`@lsp-var`, `@lsp-func`). Declaration directives work in any R file, not just cross-file contexts.

## Position-Aware Symbol Availability

Symbols from sourced files are only available AFTER the source() call site:
```r
x <- 1
source("a.R")  # Symbols from a.R available after this line
y <- foo()     # foo() from a.R is now in scope
```

## Symbol Recognition (v1 Model)

The LSP recognizes the following R constructs as symbol definitions:

**Function definitions:**
- `name <- function(...) ...`
- `name = function(...) ...`
- `name <<- function(...) ...`

**Variable definitions:**
- `name <- <expr>`
- `name = <expr>`
- `name <<- <expr>`

**String-literal assign():**
- `assign("name", <expr>)` - only when the name is a string literal

**Limitations:**
- Dynamic `assign()` calls (e.g., `assign(varname, value)`) are not recognized
- `set()` calls are not recognized
- Only top-level assignments are tracked for cross-file scope

Undefined variable diagnostics are only suppressed for symbols recognized by this model.

## Symbol Removal Tracking (rm/remove)

The LSP tracks when variables are removed from scope via `rm()` or `remove()` calls. This enables accurate undefined variable diagnostics when code uses `rm()` to delete variables.

**Supported Patterns:**

| Pattern | Extracted Symbols |
|---------|-------------------|
| `rm(x)` | `["x"]` |
| `rm(x, y, z)` | `["x", "y", "z"]` |
| `rm(list = "x")` | `["x"]` |
| `rm(list = c("x", "y"))` | `["x", "y"]` |
| `remove(x)` | `["x"]` |
| `rm(x, list = c("y", "z"))` | `["x", "y", "z"]` |

**Unsupported Patterns (No Symbols Extracted):**

| Pattern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `rm(list = var)` | Dynamic variable - cannot determine symbols at static analysis time |
| `rm(list = ls())` | Dynamic expression - result depends on runtime state |
| `rm(list = ls(pattern = "..."))` | Pattern-based removal - cannot determine matching symbols statically |
| `rm(x, envir = my_env)` | Non-default environment - removal doesn't affect global scope tracking |

**Behavior:**
- `rm()` and `remove()` are treated identically (they are aliases in R)
- Removals inside functions only affect that function's local scope
- Removals at the top-level affect global scope
- Symbols can be re-defined after removal and will be back in scope
- The `envir=` argument is checked: calls with `envir = globalenv()` or `envir = .GlobalEnv` are processed normally, but any other `envir=` value causes the call to be ignored for scope tracking

**Example:**
```r
x <- 1
y <- 2
rm(x)
# x is no longer in scope here - using x would trigger undefined variable diagnostic
# y is still in scope
x <- 3  # x is back in scope after re-definition
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Cross-File Setup
```r
# main.R
source("utils.R")
result <- helper_function(42)  # helper_function from utils.R
```

```r
# utils.R
helper_function <- function(x) { x * 2 }
```

### Backward Directive with Call-Site
```r
# child.R
# @lsp-sourced-by ../main.R line=10
# Symbols from main.R (lines 1-9) are available here
my_var <- parent_var + 1
```

### Working Directory Override
```r
# scripts/analysis.R
# @lsp-working-directory /data
source("helpers.R")  # Resolves to <workspace>/data/helpers.R
```

### Forward Directive for Dynamic Paths
```r
# main.R
# When source() path is computed dynamically, use @lsp-source to tell the LSP
config_file <- paste0(env, "_config.R")
source(config_file)  # LSP can't resolve this dynamically

# @lsp-source configs/dev_config.R
# Now the LSP knows about symbols from dev_config.R
```

### Forward Directive with Working Directory
```r
# scripts/runner.R
# @lsp-cd /data/project
# @lsp-source utils.R
# utils.R resolves to <workspace>/data/project/utils.R (uses @lsp-cd)
```

### Forward Directive with Explicit Call-Site
```r
# main.R
# @lsp-source helpers.R line=50
# Symbols from helpers.R become available at line 50
# This is useful when the actual source() call is later in the file
```

### Circular Dependency Detection
```r
# a.R
source("b.R")  # ERROR: Circular dependency if b.R sources a.R
```

```r
# b.R
source("a.R")  # Creates cycle back to a.R
```
