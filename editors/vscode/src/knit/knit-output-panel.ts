/**
 * Webview panel that renders a single `.Rmd`'s rendered HTML output in
 * an `<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin">` with Refresh / Open-in-
 * Browser / theme-toggle toolbar buttons.
 *
 * See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-knit-panel-per-file-design.md`
 * and the prior `2026-05-17-knit-output-webview-design.md`.
 *
 * Per-source registry: one panel per `.Rmd`, keyed by `sourceUri.fsPath`
 * to match the in-flight gate in `knit-commands.ts` (which also keys by
 * fsPath so the same file under different relative URIs collapses).
 * New panels anchor to `previewColumn` so they stack as tabs in a
 * single "preview" column rather than scattering.
 *
 * Architecture (unchanged from the singleton implementation):
 *  - Outer Raven-controlled shell document owns the CSP (in `<head>`),
 *    the toolbar, and a nonce'd `<script>` that posts messages.
 *  - Inner `<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin" srcdoc="…">` embeds the
 *    rendered HTML inline. `allow-same-origin` is required because a
 *    bare `sandbox=""` would give the iframe an opaque origin that
 *    bypasses VS Code's webview service worker (Electron falls back
 *    to DNS resolution, which fails with `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`).
 *    Scripts, forms, and popups are still blocked.
 *  - `localResourceRoots` is confined to `path.dirname(outputPath)`,
 *    where rmarkdown's `_files/` figure directories sit.
 *
 * Singleton → per-source: subsequent knits of the *same* source reuse
 * the panel and swap iframe content. Knits of different sources open
 * separate panels. If a panel's `outputPath` rootDir changes (rare —
 * e.g. user edited `output_dir`), only that panel is disposed and
 * recreated in its current column (`localResourceRoots` is immutable
 * post-creation — same workaround `help-panel.ts` uses).
